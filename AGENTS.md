# AGENTS.md

## Agentic Loop is the subject here, not the process

This repository *authors* the Agentic Loop methodology. `AGENTIC_LOOP.md`,
`agents/`, `skills/`, and `backends/` are the product being maintained – they
are **artifacts to edit**, not a workflow to adopt for work in this repo.

Do not read `AGENTIC_LOOP.md` and then take on its roles, task-record
contract, worktree/parallel-lane rules, or event logging on your own
initiative. Ordinary work here – editing docs, fixing skills/backends,
answering questions, one-off changes – follows the rest of this AGENTS.md
directly, as normal manual repository work.

Only operate *as* Agentic Loop (adopt roles, create task records, spin up
worktrees/lanes, log events) when the user explicitly asks to run or dogfood
the methodology against this tree. Reading `AGENTIC_LOOP.md` to edit it or to
answer a question about it is fine and expected; adopting it as your process
is not.

## Purpose

This file defines repository-wide rules for Agentic Loop itself.

Agentic Loop is a reusable, Markdown-first workflow toolkit for downstream repositories. It is maintained manually as normal repository work. Do not run Agentic Loop as an autonomous loop against itself.

## Source of Truth

Use these files as the durable repository contract:

1. [README.md](README.md)
2. [AGENTIC_LOOP.md](AGENTIC_LOOP.md)
3. [agents/](agents/)
4. [skills/](skills/)
5. [backends/](backends/)

The `docs/` directory is the user-facing setup and authoring surface. Keep it practical and adoption-oriented.
Stable Agentic Loop vocabulary belongs in `AGENTIC_LOOP.md`.

## Optional private project context

When `PROJECT_CONTEXT_ROOT` is set and a request involves product direction,
architecture tradeoffs, prioritization, or development recommendations, read
`PROJECT.md`, `STRATEGY.md`, `STATUS.md`, and relevant `decisions/` entries from
that directory before recommending a direction.

That context supplements but never overrides this public repository's source of
truth. Surface conflicts explicitly, and never copy private planning or decision
content into public files unless the user explicitly promotes it.

Repository layout ownership:

- The toolkit repo authors canonical source at the repository root (`AGENTIC_LOOP.md`, `agents/`, `skills/`, `backends/`, `commands/`, `memory/`, `config.json`, `agenticloop.template.json`, `manifest.json`).
- The installer assembles that source into `agenticloop/` inside target projects.
- `.agenticloop/` is target-owned workflow state.
- Host folders are generated shims and must not become tracked canonical source.

## Repository Scope

Agentic Loop contains reusable process assets only:

- host-neutral skills,
- host-neutral role definitions,
- task backend projection docs,
- workflow methodology,
- host setup documentation,
- validation and setup helpers.

Do not add downstream product code, application stacks, database migrations, seed data, generated caches, runtime artifacts, or raw agent transcripts.

## Development Stage

Stage: **expansion**. Grow Agentic Loop's capability through shared core
mechanisms rather than parallel ones: extend or correct the canonical role
source (`agents/`), skill source (`skills/`), adapter paths (`src/adapters/`),
and methodology (`AGENTIC_LOOP.md`) instead of adding a second implementation
beside them.

- Rationale: active capability growth without a frozen compatibility policy.
- Revisit when: a stable compatibility/support policy is adopted, or the
  role/skill/adapter surface is treated as feature-complete and work shifts to
  stabilization or maintenance.
- Release, compatibility, deprecation, and adoption decisions are owned and
  recorded in [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md). They do not change the current
  expansion stage.

## Core Rules

- Keep the toolkit project-agnostic. Use "target project" language unless a file is explicitly an example.
- Phase M's "no permanent split / dogfood the same tree" rule is superseded. Keep authored package source at the repository root and keep installed target paths under `agenticloop/`.
- Keep `agents/` as the single canonical role source in this repo.
- Keep `skills/` as the single canonical skill source in this repo.
- Keep `backends/` as task-record storage projection docs in this repo, not duplicated workflows.
- Do not duplicate skill payloads into adapter-specific directories as tracked source material.
- Do not duplicate role prompts into adapter-specific directories as tracked source material.
- Keep downstream setup Markdown-first. Required future automation should be cross-platform and `npx`-based.
- Treat Python, PowerShell, and Bash scripts as repository-maintenance or host-specific helpers, not the downstream product contract.
- Keep docs ASCII unless there is a clear reason otherwise.

## Validation Expectations

Normal downstream validation uses the Node CLI:

```text
npx agenticloop validate
```

After editing any skill, run the same command. It validates frontmatter, cross-links, OpenCode prompt references, config consistency, and task-record content without requiring a tracked generated docs snapshot.

```text
npm test
```

runs the full Node test suite, which covers skill validation, strict JSON config loading, OpenCode markdown adapter validation, init behavior, and bootstrap-labels dry-run.

## Documentation Rules

- Keep the README focused on identity, quick start, and documentation links.
- Keep setup instructions under `docs/*-setup.md` and `docs/getting-started.md`.
- Keep role definitions under `agents/` in this repo and under `agenticloop/agents/` in generated targets.
- Keep backend projection rules under `backends/` in this repo and under `agenticloop/backends/` in generated targets.
- Keep skill authoring rules in `docs/skill-anatomy.md`.
- Keep operational workflow rules in `AGENTIC_LOOP.md` and `skills/` in this repo, preserving target-facing `agenticloop/...` references inside installed assets.
- Do not keep historical cleanup plans in active docs; use git history for that.

## Change Hygiene

- Keep changes scoped to the current task.
- Do not revert user changes unless explicitly asked.
- Do not commit secrets, local session stores, temporary outputs, generated caches, or runtime logs.
- Keep scratch files inside `.agenticloop/tmp/` when a temporary file is genuinely required.

## CodeGraph

In repositories indexed by CodeGraph (a `.codegraph/` directory exists at the repo root), reach for it BEFORE grep/find or reading files when you need to understand or locate code:

- **MCP tool** (when available): `codegraph_explore` answers most code questions in one call – the relevant symbols' verbatim source plus the call paths between them, including dynamic-dispatch hops grep can't follow. Name a file or symbol in the query to read its current line-numbered source. If it's listed but deferred, load it by name via tool search.
- **Shell** (always works): `codegraph explore "<symbol names or question>"` prints the same output.

If there is no `.codegraph/` directory, skip CodeGraph entirely – indexing is the user's decision.
