# Workflow Examples

Agentic Loop is a Markdown-first workflow toolkit. The examples below are
project-agnostic: they show how a target project can run a small software
delivery loop without replacing that project's own contract docs.

## Small Software-Delivery Loop

### 1. Scaffold or refresh the overlay

```text
npx agenticloop setup
npx agenticloop update
```

`setup` is the recommended first-run path: it scaffolds or repairs the overlay
and confirms the project profile in one guided pass. (The deterministic
`npx agenticloop init` scaffold remains available for advanced, non-guided
use.) The overlay includes `agenticloop/AGENTIC_LOOP.md`, `.agenticloop/project.md`,
`.agenticloop/decisions/`, `.agenticloop/improvements/`, `.agenticloop/tasks/`,
`agenticloop/agents/`, `agenticloop/backends/`, `agenticloop/skills/`, and `.agenticloop/tmp/`. It does not overwrite an
existing `AGENTS.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, or architecture doc. Decision
records under `.agenticloop/decisions/` stay separate from task records and are
used only for durable project decisions. `.agenticloop/improvements/` is created
on first proposal, not by setup or init. To also generate a host adapter
config, choose host integration during setup (or use the direct
`npx agenticloop init --adapter opencode`, `codex`, or `claude-code` path).
`update` refreshes Agentic Loop-owned assets and regenerates existing adapter
artifacts without replacing target-owned config.

### 2. Validate setup

```text
npx agenticloop validate
```

### 3. Optional: bootstrap GitHub labels

Skip this step when using the default files backend.

```text
npx agenticloop bootstrap-labels --dry-run
npx agenticloop bootstrap-labels --repo owner/repo --task-id T-001
```

If the project uses grouping, add `--group <id>`. Explicit phase-profile
example:

```text
npx agenticloop bootstrap-labels --repo owner/repo --group 1 --task-id P1-01
```

### 4. Generate the OpenCode adapter

```text
npx agenticloop generate opencode
```

### 5. Start the host

```text
opencode
```

### 6. Start Agentic Loop in OpenCode

```text
/agenticloop [task-id or task description]
```

### 7. Task-record creation and delegation check

The orchestrator first reports whether a real host delegation mechanism exists
for maintainer. It then delegates to the maintainer, or records why a bounded
one-step fallback is being used. The maintainer creates the durable task
record:

- For files: create `.agenticloop/tasks/<TASK-ID>.md` and keep durable state such as
  `status`, `implementation_artifact`, and `review_status` in frontmatter.
- For GitHub: create an issue using the task-record template from `[[task-record-contract]]`.

Before requesting operator activation, establish the initial contract baseline,
settle the serial readiness transaction, and run handoff preflight. Serial
readiness observes declared dependency carriers directly; it needs no snapshot
or decomposition:

```text
npx agenticloop task readiness-plan T-001 --actor "<git-author>" --authority "<kind:reference>" --base HEAD --json > .agenticloop/tmp/T-001-readiness-plan.json
npx agenticloop task readiness-apply T-001 --plan .agenticloop/tmp/T-001-readiness-plan.json --dry-run --json
npx agenticloop task readiness-apply T-001 --plan .agenticloop/tmp/T-001-readiness-plan.json --yes --json
npx agenticloop task handoff-preflight T-001 --json
```

Stop for human approval only after activation is the remaining blocker.

### 8. Activate the tasks

Authoring a task record is not authorization to work on it. No host can prove
activation from inside a session, so the operator does it explicitly, in their
own terminal:

```text
npx agenticloop activate T-001
```

The command shows the exact task ids, carriers, contract digests, repository,
and resulting assurance, then asks for a typed confirmation. Then continue in
the same OpenCode session. Several tasks can share one confirmation:

```text
npx agenticloop activate T-016 T-017
```

A decomposed work unit can be activated from its committed decomposition:

```text
npx agenticloop activate --work-unit phase:4
```

Migrating an existing project needs nothing else: the tasks keep their ids,
bodies, history, and decomposition state. Check state at any time with
`npx agenticloop activation status`.

From here, dispatch and closeout report both assurance dimensions truthfully:

```text
activation: operator_confirmed
return:     session_reported
```

Neither is host-authenticated. To require `host_signed` activation and
`host_receipt` returns, register a protected host adapter with
`npx agenticloop host-trust register ...` and pin hardened mode.

Select a protected return adapter independently with `--return-adapter` when a
host receipt is required. For files, retain the role-start carrier, use `task
evidence` to record artifact, summary/check, and outcome mutations, then run
`task verify-return` and `task review-prepare <id>`. Missing evidence never
satisfies a minimum. Genuinely
pre-activation work may use the explicit interactive standard-only
`--legacy-unactivated --legacy-reason <text>` waiver, which makes no activation
claim; hardened mode rejects it.

### 9. Engineer implementation

After approval, the orchestrator delegates to the engineer. The engineer:

1. Receives the packet from `npx agenticloop task prepare-dispatch <id> --host
   <host> --role engineer --output <packet-path> --json` after guarded role start
   has consumed and revalidated it.
2. Confirms scope, out of scope, acceptance criteria, and required checks; uses
   `[[tdd-implementation]]` for behavior changes and
   `[[debugging-before-fixes]]` if a check fails.
3. Completes and commits product work, then publishes artifact, summary/check
   summary, and non-authoritative outcome with `task evidence`.
4. Updates the role-start scratch aggregate with `task check-evidence-update`,
   which commits each invocation's immutable execution artifact under
   `.agenticloop/checks/<id>/`, and performs no mutation
   before `task prepare-return`.
5. Has the receiver run `task verify-return <id> --packet <packet-path> --return
   <return-path> --from-current-repository`; only then starts review.
6. Uses `task measure <id> --json` for final counters rather than maintaining
   attempt or invocation totals in prose.

Packet, evidence, and return paths are target-relative. The CLI authors those
artifacts: do not inspect or hand-author their JSON/digests, and never treat host
status, messages, opaque handles, or cancellation observations as a return or as
proof of cancellation.

For files-backed work, the implementation artifact and review outcome stay in the task file. For
GitHub-backed work, they project to the linked PR and review markers.

### 10. Maintainer review

The orchestrator routes the implementation artifact to the maintainer. The
maintainer uses `[[review-and-accept]]`, checks for an existing review marker on
the current artifact revision, and posts exactly one review outcome plus its
provenance (`review_mode`):

<!-- agenticloop:canonical-review-marker accepted -->
```text
AGENT_REVIEW_STATUS: accepted
AGENT_REVIEW_MODE: host_subagent
AGENT_REVIEW_ARTIFACT: a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8c9d0e1f2a3b4c5d6e7f8a9b0

[[agent: maintainer]]
```

or

<!-- agenticloop:canonical-review-marker needs_revision -->
```text
AGENT_REVIEW_STATUS: needs_revision
AGENT_REVIEW_MODE: host_subagent
AGENT_REVIEW_ARTIFACT: a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8c9d0e1f2a3b4c5d6e7f8a9b0
AGENT_REVIEW_FINDINGS: F-1

[[agent: maintainer]]
```

The examples above are fenced only for documentation. A live marker must be posted
outside any fenced code block, blockquote, or indented code so the audit discovers
it; markers inside such regions are treated as quoted examples, not live state.

For files-backed work the same values are set in task-file frontmatter
(`review_status` and `review_mode`).

### 11. Closeout

The maintainer runs `[[task-closeout]]`, a verify-and-mark gate. It confirms the
inline `## Scope Completed` summary and evidence in each task record are
complete, then posts an `AGENT_CLOSEOUT_STATUS` marker citing the covered task
ids. In grouped projects this happens at group boundaries; in flat projects it
runs when a human-identified task set finishes. Closeout does not write a
separate summary file. Use `closeout prepare` to create a transient packet under
`.agenticloop/tmp/`, inspect or dry-run `closeout record`, then apply it with
`--yes`. The four truthful states are `complete`, `follow_up_required`,
`needs_context`, and `blocked`; only the first is completion.

When useful, include the optional `## Trace` section in the inline task summary
following the shape in `agenticloop/memory/work-unit-summary.md`.

When event logging is enabled and the task is complete, run a strict audit:

```text
npx agenticloop event-logging audit --task T-001
```

## Bounded implementation discovery

The context set an agent starts from is closed: the project map, the task record,
the selected source documents, linked decisions, and the active backend
projection. Agents do not expand that normative set on their own.

They may still discover how code fits together while implementing. Task-scoped
discovery – available repository indexing or language-aware symbol/reference
and caller/callee lookup, exact identifier or known-path search, focused test
discovery, relevant version-control history, and directly connected schemas,
generated consumers, callers, or tests – is permitted by default,
bounded to one discovery pass and at most six previously unnamed paths or symbol
bodies. A caller or test found this way can be inspected and, when needed to
satisfy the task, changed with a recorded deviation. Broad repository dumps and
indiscriminate full-file loading remain prohibited. Discovery that exceeds the
bound, crosses into a new domain, or contradicts the task scope routes to
`needs_context`. See Context Read Discipline in `agenticloop/AGENTIC_LOOP.md`.

## Routing durable project knowledge

While implementing, work often turns up knowledge worth keeping. Route each kind
to one durable destination instead of one catch-all store. A generic example:

- A task-specific observation ("this run needed `--no-cache` once") stays in the
  current task record and goes no further.
- A reusable operator runbook (how to stand up the local test database) is
  written to normal project documentation, for example `docs/testing.md`.
- A compact, current, non-binding project-wide operating fact is recorded in
  `## Project Operating Facts` in `.agenticloop/project.md`, linking to that
  runbook rather than duplicating it:

  ```markdown
  - `PF-local-postgres-tests` -- Local PostgreSQL tests use the Compose `test`
    profile and port 5436. Source: `docs/testing.md#local-postgres-tests`.
    Revisit when: the test service, port, or test runner changes.
  ```

- A binding rule ("all new services must use the shared connection pool") is
  escalated to a proposed/accepted decision record under
  `.agenticloop/decisions/`, not a project fact.

The detailed runbook and the compact project-map pointer may coexist. When work
reveals a supported fact, the engineer returns it as a candidate, the
orchestrator offers capture at a natural checkpoint, and the maintainer records
it; declining or deferring capture never blocks task completion. See the Project
Operating Facts section in `agenticloop/AGENTIC_LOOP.md`.

## Review provenance and independent review

Every recorded review outcome carries a `review_mode` describing how it was
performed:

- `host_subagent` -- a separate host subagent reviewed it;
- `explicit_agent_invocation` -- a separately invoked review agent;
- `single_agent_fallback` -- same-session review by the acting agent;
- `independent_human` -- a durable human review or confirmation.

### Delegation fallback vs review fallback

`single_agent_fallback` names two different things; keep them apart:

- **Delegation fallback** (`delegation_mode: single_agent_fallback` on
  `role.invoked`) means real role delegation was unavailable or a concrete attempt
  failed. It requires a structured `fallback_cause` (`mechanism_absent` or
  `invocation_failed`) and a reason. A new review round is never a fallback cause.
- **Review fallback** (`review_mode: single_agent_fallback`) means the review
  happened in the acting session and is not independent. It is legal for ordinary
  tasks even when the role was delegated for real.

A fallback review mode does not prove a Maintainer Review Fixup. Only the durable
`## Maintainer Review Fixup` subsection plus `Task:`/`Agent: maintainer` commit
attribution identify a fixup. Only a fixup whose resulting artifact is the
current head forces the current review into fallback mode; a superseded
historical fixup still counts toward the one-episode-per-task limit but a later
genuinely delegated re-review of a newer revision may record `host_subagent`
(see the review-and-accept skill). On GitHub that count includes fixup disclosures
from replacement PRs cross-referenced by the same task issue, not only comments
on the PR currently under audit. Ordinary tasks may use same-session review;
independent-review tasks may not be accepted that way. A human who directly
continues an already-active maintainer session records a concise
`continuation_reason` on the review telemetry rather than a failed delegation
attempt, and still cannot accept an independent-review task.

When surfacing the review mode to a human, prefer explicit wording over the bare
word "fallback", for example:

```text
Review execution: same session (review_mode: single_agent_fallback)
```

Keep the machine value for compatibility, but do not present "fallback" without
this context.

Ordinary tasks can be accepted through an honestly recorded
`single_agent_fallback`. Set `independent_review_required: true` on the task
record before implementation for higher-assurance work – security or
authorization boundaries; secrets, credentials, or permissions; destructive or
irreversible data operations; production or release controls; or public API and
schema migrations. When that flag is set, acceptance cannot rest on same-session
fallback: use `host_subagent`, `explicit_agent_invocation`, or `independent_human`.
`independent_human` must include a recorded reference (`human_review_ref` for the
files backend, where presence is checked procedurally) or a GitHub review/approval
reference resolved by the GitHub audit, not merely a supervising human in the
session. The audit discovers markers from both PR issue comments and PR review
bodies; independent-human evidence is resolved separately through the GitHub REST
reviews endpoint. The audit fetches and normalizes live native reviews; only an
explicit GitHub `User` identity counts as human, the review must be bound to the
current PR head, and the required review state is outcome-sensitive (`APPROVED` for
accepted, `CHANGES_REQUESTED` for needs_revision). Missing or malformed review data
fails conservatively.

## Atomic sibling readiness

For three independently authored siblings in one work unit, store a closed
task-to-snapshot map and settle them against one final inventory:

```text
npx agenticloop task readiness-plan --tasks T-020 T-021 T-022 \
  --work-unit milestone:M01 --actor "Maintainer Name" --authority plan:M01 \
  --base HEAD --dependencies-by-task .agenticloop/tmp/M01-dependencies.json \
  --json > .agenticloop/tmp/M01-readiness-plan.json
npx agenticloop task readiness-apply --plan .agenticloop/tmp/M01-readiness-plan.json --dry-run --json
npx agenticloop task readiness-apply --plan .agenticloop/tmp/M01-readiness-plan.json --yes --json
```

The plan validates all tasks before writing. The commit subject is
`chore(milestone:M01): settle readiness`; every decomposition binds the same
final inventory and work-unit scan. Warning diagnostics remain visible and do
not block. A changed dependency snapshot for any member stales the whole scan.

## Resume after a failed parent response

Suppose a Maintainer child returned a committed artifact, then the provider
socket failed before the Orchestrator answered. On resume, first acknowledge a
queued pause, then inspect the durable task/backend record and Git commit. Match
them to the outstanding coordinator action and perform only that action. Session
metadata may corroborate the event as `session_reported`; it does not become
authenticated host evidence. Store a compact checkpoint, not the transcript.
Repeating these steps over unchanged state is a no-op.

## Propose a downstream toolkit escalation

Keep current target-project knowledge in Project Operating Facts. When a human
chooses to promote a toolkit defect, create a closed facts JSON and run
`improvement propose-toolkit-escalation` to a target-relative tmp file. Review
the sanitized proposal manually, transfer it, and recreate/import it in the
toolkit repository with that repository's durable references. The downstream
command never writes to the toolkit repository.
