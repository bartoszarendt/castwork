# Getting Started

Agentic Loop is a Markdown-first workflow toolkit. You can use the core loop
without installing a runtime: give your agent the repository rules, the
methodology, and the relevant skills.

The default task backend is files. No GitHub account, repository, or labels are
required for normal operation. GitHub coordination is an explicit opt-in: an
existing GitHub remote, CI workflows, or issue templates never opt a project
into the GitHub task backend on their own.

## Quick Start

Run in an existing project directory:

```text
npx agenticloop setup
```

Setup is the recommended one-command onboarding path. It detects the project,
collects your decisions, shows one complete plan, and asks before the first
mutation. It scaffolds a fresh target or repairs a partial one, and it is
idempotent: running it twice changes nothing the second time.

This creates:

```text
agenticloop/                   toolkit-owned canonical source
.agenticloop/project.md        project map (starts with an unconfirmed human-controlled stage; implementation-lane ceiling, backend, naming, grouping, typed docs, optional evidence notes)
.agenticloop/decisions/        decision records
.agenticloop/improvements/     improvement proposals (created on first proposal)
.agenticloop/tasks/            task record files (completion summaries live inline)
.agenticloop/tmp/              gitignored scratch directory
```

No adapter config file is created unless you choose host integration. No
GitHub setup is needed.

`agenticloop/` is toolkit-owned source refreshed by `agenticloop update`.
`.agenticloop/` is target-owned state. Host-native output such as `.opencode/`
or `.claude/` is generated shim material.

Path convention: toolkit-owned canonical assets (agents, skills, backends) live
under `agenticloop/` (no dot). Target-owned state (project map, tasks,
summaries, decisions, logs, tmp) lives under `.agenticloop/` (with dot). Never
reference `.agenticloop/agents/`, `.agenticloop/skills/`, or
`.agenticloop/backends/`; those paths do not exist.

Decision records live under `.agenticloop/decisions/`. They are separate from
task records and summaries and are used only for durable project decisions that
constrain future work.

## Guided Setup

`npx agenticloop setup` follows six steps: **Detect, Review, Choose, Plan,
Apply, Verify**. Detection and model discovery are read-only; nothing is
written before the final apply confirmation. Setup detects your project state,
confirms the project map, lets you choose whether to enable local event
logging, select a host adapter (or explicitly no host integration), configure
role models, and generate artifacts in one pass. It is resumable, safe to
rerun, and repairs missing scaffold state in partial installations without
overwriting target-owned content.

Preview the exact plan without writing anything:

```text
npx agenticloop setup --dry-run
```

Non-interactive automation uses `--non-interactive` (preferred) or `--yes`
(compatibility alias) with an explicit adapter:

```text
npx agenticloop setup --adapter opencode --non-interactive
```

Neither spelling confirms a missing human-controlled project profile; a fresh
non-interactive setup against an unconfirmed project map fails closed. For the
machine-readable plan contract and exit statuses, see
[docs/cli-reference.md](./cli-reference.md).

To check onboarding progress without changing files:

```text
npx agenticloop doctor
```

For host-native adapter setup without the guided flow (advanced/manual path),
run:

```text
npx agenticloop init --adapter opencode
npx agenticloop init --adapter codex
npx agenticloop init --adapter claude-code
npx agenticloop init --adapter copilot
npx agenticloop init --adapter cursor
```

Adapter init additionally creates `agenticloop.json`,
`agenticloop/config.json`, and artifacts for the selected host. Use
`--adapter all` to generate artifacts for every supported host adapter.

Fresh Codex setup writes this opinionated target-owned cost/quality profile:

| Role | Model | Reasoning effort |
|---|---|---|
| orchestrator | `gpt-5.6-luna` | `xhigh` |
| maintainer | `gpt-5.6-terra` | `xhigh` |
| engineer | `gpt-5.6-terra` | `high` |
| auditor | `gpt-5.6-sol` | `high` |

Explicit `agenticloop.json` values override these defaults. To adopt only
missing fields in an existing Codex installation, run:

```text
npx agenticloop configure models --adapter codex --profile recommended
```

The profile reports added fields and preserved explicit fields, and does not
regenerate artifacts. Run `npx agenticloop generate codex` afterward when needed.

For Claude Code, `init --adapter claude-code` is the repo-local Mode B adapter:
it generates `.claude/commands/agenticloop.md`, `.claude/agents/`, and one public
`.claude/skills/agenticloop/SKILL.md` with internal
`references/skills/<name>/reference.md` procedure copies, plus
`.claude/settings.local.json` by default.
That local settings file is gitignored automatically. If you want one shared
Claude Code install across many target projects, use the separate root plugin
packaging flow in [docs/claude-code-setup.md](claude-code-setup.md).

For Copilot, `init --adapter copilot` generates
`.github/agents/*.agent.md`, one public `.github/skills/agenticloop/SKILL.md`
with internal `references/skills/<name>/reference.md` procedure copies and
backend references, plus `.github/prompts/agenticloop.prompt.md` for Copilot
IDE prompt-file surfaces. In Copilot CLI, activation is explicit with
`/agenticloop`. It does not generate `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.

For Cursor, `init --adapter cursor` generates
`.cursor/agents/*.md` plus one public `.cursor/skills/agenticloop/SKILL.md`
with internal `references/skills/<name>/reference.md` procedure copies and
backend references. Activation is explicit with `/agenticloop`. It does not
generate `.cursor/rules/` by default.

To refresh an existing overlay after upgrading the package, use the portable
repository-only path:

```text
npx agenticloop update --repository-only --dry-run
npx agenticloop update --repository-only
npx agenticloop validate
```

Commit those reviewed tracked changes once. Every clone then recreates its
ignored host integration locally:

```text
git pull --ff-only
npm ci
npx agenticloop hydrate --adapter opencode
git status --short
```

Running clone-local hydration must produce no tracked Git changes. Hydration
requires one explicit host and works both in installed target layouts and in
the Agentic Loop package source repository. Plain `update` remains temporarily
as a deprecated compatibility command that combines canonical refresh with
generated-output regeneration; do not use it for fresh-clone setup.

`init` and `setup` also install one clearly marked, manifest-owned
activation-guidance block into your repository-rules document (resolved as the
explicit `documents.rules` selection, else the first existing `AGENTS.md` /
`CLAUDE.md` / `GEMINI.md`, else a newly created `AGENTS.md`). Installing Agentic
Loop does not activate the methodology; the block just states that boundary.
Opt out with `--no-agents-guidance`, inspect with `agenticloop guidance check`,
and remove with `agenticloop guidance remove`. Only the region between the
markers and separators inserted with it is owned; the rest of the file stays
target-owned byte-for-byte. `guidance remove --force` removes only an edited
managed region, never surrounding target content. If the configured rules path
changes, check reports the existing owned path and update does not add a second
block.

Legacy combined `update` preserves target-owned `.agenticloop/project.md`, task records,
summaries, decisions, logs, and `.agenticloop/tmp/`, leaves existing
`agenticloop.json` alone, refreshes adapter output that already exists, and
refreshes an activation-guidance block it already owns (without enrolling an
installation that has none or overwriting a modified block). For OpenCode,
update regenerates the repo-local `.opencode/agents/*.md` files and
`.opencode/commands/agenticloop.md`. User-owned `opencode.jsonc` is ignored.
Use `update
--adapter <host>` to generate or refresh one specific host.

To remove the overlay, preview first and then confirm:

```text
npx agenticloop remove --dry-run
npx agenticloop remove --yes
npx agenticloop remove --yes --include-state
```

Removal is transactional. If final quarantine cleanup cannot complete after a
successful removal, the command reports the cleanup error without restoring
already committed output and leaves its `.agenticloop-remove-*` journal in the
target root. Remove that journal only after confirming the committed removal is
the intended final state.

If rollback itself cannot restore every path, the command reports that rollback
is incomplete and retains the quarantine journal instead of deleting recovery
data. Its `transaction.json` maps original target paths to the remaining backup
files. Resolve the reported filesystem obstruction and recover those paths from
the journal before removing it; an incomplete rollback is not a completed
removal.

### Migrating legacy or custom workflow roles

Transition contract v1 has a closed workflow-role registry:
`orchestrator`, `maintainer`, `engineer`, and `auditor`. Validation now fails
when `agenticloop.json`, `agenticloop/agents/`, configured `sourceFile` values,
or agent frontmatter introduce a missing, renamed, or additional workflow role.
This is a target-facing validation change; `update` does not delete or silently
reinterpret target-owned custom role configuration.

To migrate an older target:

1. Preserve any custom agent content outside the managed
   `agenticloop/agents/` namespace. If it remains useful as a host-only helper,
   place it according to that host's custom-agent conventions; it is not an
   Agentic Loop workflow role.
2. Make `agenticloop.json` extend `"./agenticloop/config.json"`. Keep overrides
   only for canonical role IDs, and remove non-registry keys from both `roles`
   and `adapters.<host>.roleSettings`.
3. Run `npx agenticloop update` to refresh the installed canonical role sources
   and already-generated adapter output from the corrected configuration.
4. Run `npx agenticloop validate`. Resolve every reported filename,
   `sourceFile`, and frontmatter mismatch before activation.

Do not rename a durable role ID in place. A future workflow-role addition or
replacement requires a versioned registry extension with capability, adapter,
history, and migration support.

## Stop the Loop

Use `stop` as the exact activation argument to deactivate Agentic Loop for this
conversation: `/agenticloop stop` in OpenCode, Claude Code repo-local, Copilot
CLI, and Cursor; `$agenticloop stop` in Codex; and `/agenticloop:stop` in the
Claude Code plugin. Stop safely checkpoints unfinished work without changing its
status merely because the user stopped, and does not commit, push, close tasks,
merge, or clean up worktrees. Resume with the normal host activation command and
a task or context argument. It is separate from host exit, host terminal stop,
task closeout, and worktree cleanup; see [Host Adapters](host-adapters.md#stop-agentic-loop).

## Adoption Modes

Agentic Loop supports two adoption paths.

### New project or template mode

Use this when starting a project from scratch or when the target project does
not yet have its own `AGENTS.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, or architecture
docs.

Run `npx agenticloop setup`. The scaffolded `.agenticloop/project.md` starts with
`setup_status: unconfirmed` and `development_stage: unconfirmed`; guided setup
walks you through confirming both before it writes them.

Before the first non-trivial task, either:

- ask the agent to run or route `setup-agenticloop`, or
- manually confirm the defaults by updating the setup fields in `.agenticloop/project.md` after reviewing the backend choice and selecting one human-confirmed development stage.

Recommended additions that `init` does not create (target-owned):

```text
AGENTS.md
IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
README.md
```

### Existing project or overlay mode

Use this when the target project already has `AGENTS.md`,
`IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, architecture docs, or other project contract docs.
Agentic Loop adds its process files beside the existing docs without
overwriting them.

Run `npx agenticloop setup` in the target project root. Setup skips existing
protected docs and adds only Agentic Loop-owned assets.

If source document names are non-standard, or if the repo may already have a
durable GitHub issue/PR workflow, use the setup skill to record confirmed typed
selections and backend review in `.agenticloop/project.md`:

```text
Use the setup-agenticloop skill to map the source documents for this project.
```

If the target project already uses the conventional document names and keeps the
files backend, still confirm the project map only after reviewing whether the
repo already shows durable GitHub workflow evidence.

When upgrading a project whose map is already confirmed but has no
`development_stage`, validation intentionally stops normal task work. Run
`npx agenticloop setup` interactively and confirm the one-time stage migration.
The migration preserves the existing project-map body and does not silently
change document selections, backend, naming, or grouping values. Missing
`default_review_budget`, `default_audit_budget`, and
`max_parallel_implementation_lanes` fields inherit `5`, `3`, and `5`.

## Configuration

### Files-first (default)

`.agenticloop/project.md` is the primary project configuration. Edit its
frontmatter to record setup confirmation, a human-confirmed development stage,
implementation-lane ceiling, typed document selections, task ID pattern, backend
choice, optional grouping, or optional process planning
conventions:

```yaml
---
setup_status: unconfirmed
setup_confirmed_at: ""
setup_confirmed_by: ""
development_stage: unconfirmed
default_review_budget: 5
default_audit_budget: 3
max_parallel_implementation_lanes: 5
task_backend: files
task_id_pattern: "T-<number>"
task_id_regex: "^T-\\d{3,}$"
task_file_template: ".agenticloop/tasks/{taskId}.md"
grouping_profile: flat
# Optional only to pin the shipped 24-hour verified-return reuse ceiling:
# return_use_freshness:
#   kind: agenticloop.return-use-freshness
#   schemaVersion: 1
#   maxAgeSeconds: 86400
# engineer_context_window_tokens: 256000
# documents:
#   plan: "ROADMAP.md"
---
```

Verified returns can authorize protected follow-on transitions for 24 hours by
default. `return_use_freshness` is optional, but if declared it must use the
complete versioned policy shown above; partial, old, future, or extended values
fail validation and protected transitions fail closed.

Default task IDs use `T-001`, `T-002`, and similar neutral numbering. Projects
that choose grouping may override this. For example, a phase-grouped project
may set `task_id_pattern: "P<phase>-<number>"` and a matching regex.
Setting `grouping_profile: phase` alone does not switch task IDs.

On the setup edit path, choose the task-ID convention from the numbered
selector. Presets write the human-readable pattern and regex together so they
cannot drift. The custom option requires an anchored regex and a safe matching
example. Automatic allocation currently supports only the recommended
`T-###` convention. For other conventions, create the task with
`agenticloop task new "Title" --scaffold --id <TASK-ID>` and then authorize it
with `npx agenticloop activate <TASK-ID>`. Passing
`--activation-input <host-capture.json>` at creation remains available for a
protected host integration that produces a supported v2 capture; no shipped
adapter supplies one.

Document roles are typed: `rules`, `plan`, `overview`, `process`, `spec`,
`design`, `context`, and `history`.

Agents use the typed selections from `.agenticloop/project.md`. When a role is
not selected, they use the bounded candidate names from the canonical registry.
They do not scan the whole repository at runtime.

For the GitHub backend, `trusted_task_contract_actors` optionally lists the
GitHub logins whose task-contract record comments are trusted. When present it
must be a non-empty list of valid logins; comparison is case-insensitive and
duplicates, empty entries, and malformed logins fail validation. Without it,
repository OWNER, MEMBER, and COLLABORATOR associations are trusted with an
explicit compatibility warning. The
legacy `github_trusted_actors` key is deprecated and honored with a
deprecation warning; prefer the canonical field.

`setup_status: unconfirmed` means the project map still needs review.
`setup_status: confirmed` requires a human-confirmed `development_stage` of
`greenfield`, `expansion`, `stabilization`, or `maintenance`; it means the
document selections, task naming, grouping, backend choice, and stage have been
reviewed for this target project. Setup can propose a stage from bounded evidence
but cannot persist it before human confirmation. A later stage transition uses a
repeat interactive profile update and also requires human confirmation.

`max_parallel_implementation_lanes` defaults to `5`. It is a ceiling only for
otherwise eligible implementation lanes, not a total live-agent budget or a
target; review, coordination, and integration lanes use their own rules.

`default_review_budget` defaults to `5`; a task's explicit `review_budget`
wins, otherwise new task records materialize this value. It is the number of
counted `needs_revision` outcomes before a Review Round Checkpoint, not a hard
review maximum. `default_audit_budget` defaults to `3`; `audit new --budget`
wins, otherwise each new audit record materializes this project value.

`backend_confirmed_at`, `backend_confirmed_by`, and `backend_evidence_summary`
are optional frontmatter notes for the bounded backend-evidence review.

Setup asks for the task backend with a numbered choice:

```text
Task backend:
  1. Files - local task records (default)
  2. GitHub - issues, labels, comments, and PR coordination
Choice [1]:
```

Blank input keeps the files default for a new installation, and the same
selector is offered during the interactive profile update for confirmed
projects, where blank input keeps the existing backend. GitHub hosting
evidence (a GitHub remote, existing CI workflows, issue templates) is shown
as informational evidence only and never selects the GitHub backend by itself;
GitHub task coordination always requires the explicit `2` selection.

Event logging is local, optional, and disabled by default
(`event_logging: disabled`). It is independent of the task backend: enabling
local event logging does not select the GitHub backend, and choosing the
GitHub backend does not enable event logging.

Interactive setup asks with a numbered choice:

```text
Event logging:
  1. Disabled - do not record workflow events (default)
  2. Enabled - write local task-scoped JSONL logs under .agenticloop/logs/
Choice [1]:
```

Blank input selects disabled for a new installation and retains the current
setting when setup is rerun. Automated setup can pass
`--event-logging enabled` or `--event-logging disabled`; when the option is
omitted in non-interactive mode, setup retains the current setting. This choice
does not create a log file immediately and does not change
`event_logging_command`.

`engineer_context_window_tokens` is optional. Set it only when the engineer
model's active context window is known and task sizing should use that value
instead of the generic examples in Agentic Loop.

### Verification operating facts

The project-map body also holds `## Verification Operating Facts`: maintainer-
owned, current cross-task facts such as a known host timeout for `npm test` and
the reversible strategy to use instead. They are not routine test history or
decision records. Exceptional per-task runs belong in `## Verification Attempts`
in the task record; a timed-out foreground run must be recorded before a retry or
handoff. Routine first-pass success stays in current final-state evidence. See
`agenticloop/skills/verification-evidence/SKILL.md` for the canonical entry and
one bounded-escalation rule.

### Project operating facts

The project-map body also holds `## Project Operating Facts`: the maintainer-
owned profile for current, mutable, non-binding project-wide operating knowledge.
Each fact is one compact bullet with a stable `PF-...` identifier, a durable
source reference, and a "Revisit when" trigger. Detailed workflows still live in
normal project documentation; a fact provides a compact current fact or a pointer
to that documentation. Binding conventions and policies route to decision records
instead, and fact capture is optional and non-blocking.

New installations receive the empty section from the scaffold. Existing
`.agenticloop/project.md` files are target-owned and are never overwritten;
`agenticloop init`, refresh, and ordinary update do not rewrite the project map,
so an existing project without the section stays valid and a maintainer can add
the section on the first approved capture. See the Project Operating Facts section
in `agenticloop/AGENTIC_LOOP.md` for the recognition test and routing ladder.

To confirm defaults manually, update the setup fields in the same file. Example:

```yaml
---
setup_status: confirmed
setup_confirmed_at: "2026-06-16"
setup_confirmed_by: "maintainer"
task_backend: files
task_id_pattern: "T-<number>"
task_id_regex: "^T-\\d{3,}$"
task_file_template: ".agenticloop/tasks/{taskId}.md"
grouping_profile: flat
---
```

### Advanced adapter config (optional)

`agenticloop.json` is adapter/tooling config for host-native integrations. It
is created only by `agenticloop init --adapter <host>` and is never created by
plain init. `.agenticloop/project.md` `task_backend` selects the active
backend. Keep backend behavior overrides under `backends.github.*` and
`backends.files.*` in `agenticloop.json`; those settings do not select the
backend.

Agentic Loop-owned adapter config uses strict JSON: `agenticloop.json`,
`agenticloop/config.json`, and `agenticloop/skills/agenticloop-tests.json`. Agentic Loop does
not own `opencode.jsonc`.

Do not put model IDs, provider names, or reasoning effort settings in
`.agenticloop/project.md`; those belong in `agenticloop.json` under
`adapters.<host>.roleSettings`.

Top-level `taskBackend` in `agenticloop.json` is legacy compatibility for
older targets and should be removed when `.agenticloop/project.md` exists.

`agenticloop/config.json` is toolkit-owned structural defaults, created alongside
`agenticloop.json` when using the adapter path.

## First Run

1. Run `npx agenticloop setup` for guided onboarding: project detection,
   confirmation, adapter selection, model configuration, and artifact generation.
   Setup shows one complete plan and requires explicit confirmation before the
   first mutation.
2. Run `npx agenticloop doctor` to inspect setup state without changing files.
3. If source document names are non-standard, the setup flow detects and proposes
   overrides; you can also edit `.agenticloop/project.md` directly.
4. If the repo has durable GitHub evidence (remote, workflows, issue templates),
   setup shows it as informational evidence only; the files backend stays the
   default. Select GitHub explicitly in the numbered backend prompt if the
   project wants GitHub coordination.
5. If using GitHub, set `task_backend: github` in `.agenticloop/project.md` and run `npx agenticloop bootstrap-labels`.
6. Run `npx agenticloop validate` to verify the setup.
7. Start the host agent. For OpenCode, run
   `/agenticloop [task-id or task description]`. For Codex, run
   `$agenticloop [task-id or task description]`; `/skills` can also select
   `Agentic Loop`, but Codex does not use a repo-local `/agenticloop` slash
   command. For Claude Code, run `/agenticloop` in repo-local Mode B or
   `/agenticloop:start` in plugin Mode A. For Copilot CLI, run `/agenticloop`;
   in Copilot IDE prompt-file surfaces, use the generated `agenticloop` prompt
   file. For Cursor, invoke `/agenticloop` in Cursor Agent chat. For other
   hosts, ask it to use Agentic Loop.

## Activating tasks for dispatch

Agentic Loop separates *asking an agent to work on a task* from *authorizing
that work*. No host can prove the second from inside a session: every shipped
adapter's request text is model-visible, so it declares activation capture
`unsupported`, permanently.

The universal path is one explicit command in your own terminal, outside the
agent session:

```text
/agenticloop T-016 T-017                  # in the agent, as usual

npx agenticloop activate T-016 T-017      # once, in your terminal
```

`activate` prints the exact tasks, carriers, contract digests, repository, work
unit, and resulting assurance, then asks you to type `activate` to confirm.
After that the tasks are eligible for dispatch if every other gate passes, and
you continue in the same project and session.

It works on every host, with no plugin. It requires a real interactive terminal
and refuses to run under CI; there is no `--yes` flag, because that would let an
agent authorize its own work.

Other forms:

```text
npx agenticloop activate --work-unit phase:4   # the committed decomposition's ready set
npx agenticloop activation status              # what is activated and still usable
npx agenticloop activation stop T-016          # stop one exact binding durably
npx agenticloop activation revoke grant:<uuid>
```

`activation stop` blocks future protected transitions for that task and
survives a lost host session. It does not cancel work already running in the
host. Resume by running `activate T-016` interactively again; this creates a
new grant and binding while the old stop tombstone remains effective for old
packets.

### Migrating an existing project

Nothing needs to be recreated. Point `activate` at the task ids you already
have:

```text
npx agenticloop activate T-016 T-017
```

Task ids, bodies, history, decomposition state, and repository state are all
preserved. A scaffold task created with `task new --scaffold` becomes
dispatchable the same way. Existing tasks that already carry
`activation_input_digest` and `activation_capture_ref` keep working unchanged.

After dispatch, run `task verify-return`. Standard mode can persist an observed
`session_reported` return without a plugin; hardened mode requires the
independently packet-bound protected return adapter and an authenticated host
receipt. Capability registration alone is not evidence that a return occurred.

The ordinary public handoff is CLI-artifact based: the orchestrator runs `npx
agenticloop task prepare-dispatch <id> --host <host> --role engineer --output
<packet-path> --json`; guarded role start consumes and revalidates it; the
files role start creates the scratch check aggregate, the engineer runs the
ordered `task evidence` commands and `task check-evidence-update`, then `task
prepare-return`; and the receiver runs `task verify-return <id> --packet
<packet-path> --return <return-path> --from-current-repository` before review.
Use target-relative artifact paths. Do not inspect internals or hand-author the
packet, evidence, return JSON, or digests. Host statuses, messages, opaque
handles, and cancellation observations are not returns; cancellation/status alone
does not establish cancellation.

The GitHub backend has no files `role-start` aggregate producer, so its
documented flow continues to run `task check-evidence-init` explicitly.

For files-backed Engineer work, do not restore the pre-start task body. Commit
the product artifact, then use `task evidence` for artifact, summary/check, and
outcome evidence with the current carrier digest. These guarded mutations preserve
the protected contract and record the carrier receipt chain. After
`task verify-return` persists the result, use `task review-prepare <id>` to enter
files review from one current carrier snapshot.

Old work units completed before activation assurance do not pass through silent
missing evidence. In standard mode, `closeout prepare --legacy-unactivated
--legacy-reason <text>` creates or reuses one interactive, short-lived signed
waiver bound to the repository, work unit, covered tasks, and current contract
digests. It makes no activation claim. Hardened mode rejects it.

### What you are told about assurance

Dispatch and closeout output states both grades plainly, for example:

```text
activation: operator_confirmed
return:     session_reported
```

`operator_confirmed` means a human at this terminal confirmed the exact scope.
`session_reported` means a role result was schema-checked and revalidated
against refetched repository evidence, but the producing role identity was not
host-authenticated. Neither is cryptographically host-authenticated, and no
output will tell you otherwise.

The same return policy applies to work-unit audit. A fresh report from a
separate Auditor invocation is accepted in standard mode as
`session_reported`; hardened mode requires the protected Auditor receipt and
records `host_receipt`. A same-session audit is invalid in both modes. The audit
record, gate, closeout packet, and final marker all preserve the observed grade
and producer-authentication state.

To require the stronger grades, register a protected host adapter
(`npx agenticloop host-trust register ...`) and set hardened mode. See
[Host Adapters](host-adapters.md#universal-activation).

Recommended prompt for hosts without command activation:

```text
Use Agentic Loop. Read .agenticloop/project.md for development_stage,
default_attempt_budget, default_review_budget, default_audit_budget,
max_parallel_implementation_lanes, task_backend, task naming, grouping rules,
and typed document selections. If setup_status is unconfirmed or the stage is
not human-confirmed, route setup-agenticloop or confirm the profile before
selecting the first task. Then identify the next task and create the task record before
implementation.
```

## How Roles Work

Roles live in `agenticloop/agents/`. They define who does what:

- `orchestrator` coordinates the loop
- `maintainer` owns task records, review, acceptance, and closeout
- `engineer` implements one scoped task record at a time
- `auditor` certifies a finished work unit against its exact integrated baseline

### Standalone maintainer, engineer, and auditor

The maintainer, engineer, and auditor are dual-mode. Besides their Agentic Loop
roles, the main agent can delegate to any of them directly as an ordinary
bounded subagent. That standalone delegation does not activate Agentic Loop and
creates no workflow state.

- A standalone maintainer performs bounded planning, decomposition, or review.
  It needs no task ID, task record, review packet, or other workflow metadata,
  and returns advisory recommendations rather than formal Agentic Loop
  acceptance or closeout. It does not implement.

- A standalone engineer implements a bounded engineering subtask. It needs no
  task ID or task record.
- A standalone auditor performs a bounded, read-only, evidence-based assessment
  of whatever scope you name. It needs no task ID, audit ID, audit record, or
  audit packet, and missing that metadata is not a blocker. It returns concise,
  non-certifying findings: no `auditor_report_v1`, no Agentic Loop verdict, and
  no contribution to the formal work-unit audit gate.

Full Agentic Loop mode is selected only by explicit activation, by explicitly
designating a durable Agentic Loop lifecycle artifact as the maintainer's
planning, review, acceptance, or closeout contract, by naming a durable task
record as the engineer's implementation contract, or by asking the auditor to
certify or re-audit a tracked work unit against an Agentic Loop audit record or
packet. A bare task ID, work-unit name, pull request, audit ID, or commit SHA
mentioned for context selects neither. When explicit Agentic Loop intent has
selected full mode, missing metadata does not silently downgrade the role.
Work-unit certification always requires a fresh, packet-bound Auditor
invocation; a standalone assessment never substitutes for it.

Host adapters bind their native agent, mode, command, or prompt mechanism to
these role files. Generated role labels come from the canonical registry while
durable config keys and filenames remain immutable `roleId`. Each generated
agent carries a short capability summary plus its declaration schema/digest and
the deterministic `.agenticloop/host-role-capabilities/<host>.json` path. The
sidecar holds the complete canonical declarations once per host. It records
whether implementation restrictions are native (`enforced`), instruction-only
(`advisory`), or unavailable and where incompatible evidence is detected.
`enforced` means every shipped tool path capable of that action is constrained:
OpenCode and Copilot Orchestrator/Auditor mutation denial is advisory while
their shell-capable routes remain, Codex is advisory, and the generated Claude
Code plan mode and Cursor read-only mode are whole-agent mechanical controls.
Advisory/unavailable bindings become version 3 typed degraded reports in the
dispatch packet and are validated with the canonical packet at authenticated
role-return import.

A cancellation-blocked return normally resumes with its authenticated producer role. Ordinary workflow/tooling blockers are non-authoritative session status and do not enter this return-resumption path. The
existing `task verify-return` command is also the blocked resume/recovery gate:
`--resume-owner` needs an exact signed redelegation record when it differs from
the producer, while `--recovery-request` needs an exact signed
`--human-disposition`. Both signatures are verified against schemaVersion 2
authority roots in the fixed external operator trust store. Repository-local,
caller-selected, unsigned, self-minted, stale, or cross-return records do not
authorize a transition. Recovery also requires explicit
`--human-disposition-authority` and `--human-disposition-key-id` selectors.
Use `scripts/sign-blocked-authority.mjs` to construct records with the canonical
serializer and signing input.

Auditor has its own model slot at `adapters.<host>.roleSettings.auditor`. The
maintainer model is never silently reused for it, because the audit exists to be
independent of the authority that accepted the work.

## Work-Unit Audit

Work-unit audit is enabled by default, including when `.agenticloop/project.md`
omits the key:

```yaml
work_unit_audit: enabled
```

With it enabled, work-unit closeout cannot publish
`AGENT_CLOSEOUT_STATUS: complete` without a current audit certificate for the
exact work unit. Certificates live under `.agenticloop/audits/<AUD-ID>.md` and
are target-owned certification state, not task records.

Typical cycle:

```text
npx agenticloop audit new --work-unit phase:4 \
  --covered-tasks T-041,T-042 --artifact commit:abc123 \
  --goal "<outcome and source>" \
  --completion-oracle "<observable completion>" \
  --evidence "<integrated evidence for commit:abc123>"
npx agenticloop audit report AUD-001 --file .agenticloop/tmp/AUD-001-run-1.json
# remediation runs as ordinary tasks, then:
npx agenticloop audit baseline AUD-001 --artifact commit:def456 \
  --covered-tasks T-041,T-042,T-055 \
  --evidence "<integrated evidence for commit:def456>"
npx agenticloop audit report AUD-001 --file .agenticloop/tmp/AUD-001-run-2.json
npx agenticloop audit gate AUD-001
```

Before the final audit command, closeout conditionally synchronizes the selected
plan only when that plan itself defines a permitted progress/status update and a
task/work-unit reference maps unambiguously to one item. That Maintainer-owned
update is integrated into the candidate first; then the baseline is refreshed,
the Auditor certifies that exact artifact, and only then can closeout publish its
complete marker. Plans without progress instructions receive no invented edit.

`audit status` remains available for diagnostics. `audit gate` is the
fail-closed closeout check. A `needs_human_decision` verdict requires a separate
recorded resolution before another Auditor report:

```text
npx agenticloop audit resolve AUD-001 \
  --authority "human: <identity>" --note "<decision and direction>"
```

`audit_budget` defaults to 3 and is separate from the default-5 `attempt_budget`
and default-5 Review Round Checkpoint threshold. After three non-certifying
reports the record blocks for human direction; a fourth requires
`npx agenticloop audit override AUD-001 --budget <n> --authority "human: <identity>"`.

To opt out, a human sets `work_unit_audit: disabled` in
`.agenticloop/project.md`. That bypasses the gate, preserves any audit history,
and never claims the work unit is certified. Re-enabling restores the gate and
again requires a current certificate.

The full procedure lives in `agenticloop/skills/work-unit-audit/SKILL.md`.

## How Skills Work

Each skill is a directory with a `SKILL.md` file. The frontmatter description
tells the agent when the skill applies. The body gives the process and
verification rules.

Do not load every skill into context at once. Load or invoke the skill that
matches the current task:

- task scoping: `task-record-contract`
- implementation: `tdd-implementation`
- failing checks: `debugging-before-fixes`
- evidence: `verification-evidence`
- review: `review-and-accept`
- blocked state: `blocked-state`
- process changes: `change-request-gate`
- work-unit certification: `work-unit-audit`
- closeout: `task-closeout`
- initial project setup: `setup-agenticloop`

Target-project domain skills may also be used when they are visible to the host
and their triggers apply. Agentic Loop skills remain authoritative for task
records, evidence, review, blocked state, and closeout.

## Task Backends

Backend projection docs live in `agenticloop/backends/`. They explain how the same
task-record operations map to local files or GitHub.

The files backend is the supported default for new projects with no durable
GitHub task-workflow evidence. See `agenticloop/backends/files.md`.

Files-backed task records keep durable state in the task file itself. In practice,
that means frontmatter such as `status`, `implementation_artifact`,
`review_status`, and, for change requests, `type: change-request` plus
`approved: true` after human approval.

GitHub issues and pull requests are an optional projection for projects that
explicitly choose `task_backend: github`. See `agenticloop/backends/github.md`.

Before delegating an implementation, run the read-only handoff preflight:
`npx agenticloop task handoff-preflight <task-id> --json`. If only derived
evidence is stale, request a plan with `--repair-plan <path>` and apply it later
with `npx agenticloop task refresh-handoff-evidence <task-id> --plan <path>
--yes --json`. The refresh cannot alter task contracts, activation, review
decisions, or product files.

### Event logging

Event logging is disabled by default. Enable it in `.agenticloop/project.md`
with `event_logging: enabled`. `event_logging_command` can stay blank; agents
test `npx agenticloop --help` once when enabled and use `npx agenticloop` if
that check succeeds.

### Task completion summaries

Per-task completion summaries are always required. They are written into
`.agenticloop/tasks/<TASK-ID>.md` as the `## Scope Completed` or legacy
`## Implementation Summary` section. This applies to all projects regardless of
grouping profile.

There is no separate `.agenticloop/summaries/` directory. The completion summary
is the inline `## Scope Completed` section in each task record. Closeout is a
verify-and-mark gate that confirms those inline summaries are complete and posts
a status marker; it does not write a separate summary file.
