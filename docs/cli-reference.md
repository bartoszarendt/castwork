# Agentic Loop CLI Reference

The shipped contract for the `agenticloop` command line: command hierarchy,
setup versus init, interactive and non-interactive behavior, dry-run and JSON
plans, stdout/stderr rules, exit statuses, capability behavior, and
compatibility aliases.

### Task lifecycle additions

- `task explain <id> [--action <action-id>]` is files-only and derives bounded
  current task availability for `prepare_dispatch`, `role_start`,
  `prepare_return`, `review`, and `audit`. It is read-only, grants no authority,
  and writes nothing. The protected action inputs are, respectively: dispatch
  host/role or advanced input/packet selection; a role-start packet; return
  packet, check evidence, outcome, and output; a current verified return; and,
  when audit is enabled, a current work-unit candidate with coverage. `unknown`
  explains unavailable protected inputs; it is not a complete legality decision.
  Invalid action syntax exits `2`; a missing task, repository, or configured
  backend exits `1`; an `unknown` projection for an existing readable task exits
  `0`.
- `task measure <id>` reports bounded derived operational measurement without
  storing it.
- `task adopt-historical` records a reduced-assurance terminal adoption for
  work that genuinely predates canonical lifecycle evidence; `task adopt-commit`
  records a `non_authenticated_claim` for one attributable, in-scope commit
  range into an existing attempt. The latter preserves bounded attempt context
  but never authenticates claimed origin or substitutes for permission, Git
  attribution, or fresh required-check, review, and audit certification.
- `task abandon-attempt` and `task attempt-status` respectively discard a
  named live attempt under durable authority and report whether a new packet may
  be minted.
- `task commit-message` writes a canonically trailered workflow commit message
  without committing. `task prepare-product-commit` derives the exact task-owned
  product paths after work and writes the corresponding product commit message.
- `task refresh-handoff-receipt` refreshes only stale derived handoff evidence
  under its guarded plan; it cannot change the task contract, activation,
  review decision, or product files.
- `task review-attach-outcome <id> --return-verification <record-id>
  --maintainer-receipt <receipt.json>` atomically attaches one later
  host-authenticated Maintainer outcome to the already prepared files-backed
  review entry for that exact verified return and current review history.

Help conventions:

- `agenticloop` with no command prints a short first-use screen.
- `agenticloop help` (or `--help`, `-h`) prints the complete catalog.
- `agenticloop help <command> [subcommand]` is equivalent to
  `<command> --help` (and `<command> <subcommand> --help`). Help is always
  safe: it never invokes a command handler and never mutates a target.
- `agenticloop --version` (or `version`) prints the installed version.
- Unknown commands and options fail with exit status `2` and suggest a close
  valid spelling when one exists.
- Commands declare their positional shape. A command without declared
  positionals (for example `init`, `setup`, `update`, `validate`, `doctor`,
  `status`, `generate <host>`) accepts zero operands; required positionals
  must be present; optional positionals may be omitted; extra operands fail
  with exit status `2` before any handler or mutation runs. `--` still
  terminates option parsing, but the resulting operands must satisfy the
  declared shape, and Boolean flags never consume a following token.

## Setup versus init

Use `setup` for onboarding and repair. It detects the project, collects
decisions, shows one complete plan, asks before the first mutation, applies
the plan, and offers validation. It always composes the idempotent init plan,
so it repairs empty, current, legacy, partial, and inverse-partial targets
without overwriting target-owned content. Running setup twice produces zero
second-run mutations.

Use `init` when you want the deterministic, non-guided scaffold: files-only
(`agenticloop init`) or direct adapter scaffolding
(`agenticloop init --adapter <host>`). Both share the same planner, ownership
checks, output renderer, and executor as guided setup.

## Clone-safe update and hydration

Portable repository refresh and clone-local generation are separate commands:

```text
agenticloop update --repository-only [--target <dir>] [--dry-run] [--json] [--verbose]
agenticloop hydrate --adapter <host> [--target <dir>] [--dry-run] [--json] [--force-generated]
```

`update --repository-only` uses the lifecycle planner to refresh canonical
`agenticloop/` assets, deterministic schema migrations, an already-owned
guidance block, and managed ignore entries. It never detects adapters from
generated directories, reads generated model settings, generates host files,
or derives tracked output from ignored/untracked files. `--dry-run` performs
no writes. `--json` also implies a no-write plan and emits the same actions as
human dry-run output. The package source repository remains protected from
this lifecycle mutation.

`hydrate` requires exactly one of `opencode`, `codex`, `claude-code`,
`copilot`, or `cursor`; it never auto-detects and does not accept `all`. It
works in installed targets and in the package source layout. It reads
canonical assets and effective configuration, then invokes the shared adapter
planner, ownership preflight, and generation transaction with
`.agenticloop/local/generated-artifacts.json`. It never writes
`agenticloop.json`, `AGENTS.md`, `.gitignore`, canonical toolkit assets, or
workflow/task state. In a Git worktree every planned destination and the local
manifest must already be ignored and untracked, or hydration fails before the
first write with a repair message. Hydration requires a verifiable Git
worktree. In a non-Git directory, or when Git cannot run or inspect the
worktree, hydration fails closed instead of writing unverified local output.

Both dry-run formats list the same action paths and blockers. Exit status is
`0` for a valid plan or completed hydration, `1` for configuration,
ownership, collision, ignore, path, or apply failure, and `2` for invalid CLI
usage. `--force-generated` applies only to a modified file already proven
owned by the local manifest; it never adopts user-created files. Repeating an
unchanged hydration does not rewrite generated files or its manifest.

Plain `update` and its `upgrade` alias retain the pre-existing combined
behavior for compatibility and emit a deprecation warning. Its established
flags retain their meanings. The recommended workflow is repository-only
update followed by per-clone hydration.

Generated output is not configuration authority. Importing missing values is
an explicit, confirmed migration:

```text
agenticloop configure import-generated-models --adapter <host> --dry-run [--json]
agenticloop configure import-generated-models --adapter <host> --yes
```

The preview reports every destination setting, value, and source artifact.
The operation requires one concrete adapter, preserves explicit tracked
settings, and modifies only `agenticloop.json` after `--yes`.

## Interactive and non-interactive behavior

Interactive setup follows six steps: **Detect, Review, Choose, Plan, Apply,
Verify**. Detection and model discovery are read-only. No file is created or
changed before the final apply confirmation. Blank input takes the displayed
default; invalid input explains the valid choices and reprompts; "Files only"
and "Skip adapter setup" are one explicit "No host integration" choice.

Non-interactive setup runs with `--non-interactive` (preferred) or `--yes`
(compatibility alias) and requires `--adapter <host>`. Neither spelling
invents or confirms missing human-controlled project-profile values: a fresh
non-interactive setup against an unconfirmed project map fails closed.

Note that `--yes` has a different, confirmation-oriented meaning on commands
such as `remove` and `worktree remove` (it authorizes a mutating action).
Convergence on one meaning is deferred to a later compatibility phase.

## Dry-run and JSON plans

`init --dry-run` and `setup --dry-run` execute the real planner and perform
zero writes — no `.gitignore`, guidance, config, manifest, state, directory,
or generated-shim changes. They succeed against readable, read-only targets.
Interactive setup dry-run may collect choices but never applies.

`--dry-run --json` is non-interactive. It succeeds only when an existing
confirmed profile or explicit flags provide every human-controlled decision.
Stdout contains exactly one stable, versioned JSON plan document
(`"schemaVersion": 1`) with normalized `create`, `update`, `merge`, `remove`,
`skip`, and `blocked` actions; diagnostics go to stderr. A dry-run with
blockers exits `1` and includes the blockers; a malformed invocation exits
`2`. When target state changes between plan and apply, apply re-preflights
and fails safely instead of applying a stale assumption.

Init's activation-guidance mutation is part of the plan, so `init --dry-run`
(human and JSON) shows the exact `AGENTS.md` guidance action normal init
would apply, and normal init performs no mutation absent from its plan.
`--no-agents-guidance` (or `--agents-guidance off`) excludes the action from
the plan.

## Plan application and failure semantics

Setup and init apply one preflighted lifecycle plan built from ordered
segments (scaffold batches, merge executors such as guidance, and adapter
generation). The contract is **per-segment, fail-stop, and
rerun-repairable** — not globally atomic:

- The complete plan is preflighted before the first mutation (blockers,
  adapter collisions, and stale-plan drift all fail closed up front). Legacy
  renames fingerprint both their source and destination.
- Each built-in segment is atomic: a failed segment is rolled back internally
  and its pre-state is restored (file bytes are restored exactly, stale empty
  directories are recreated, and only transaction-created directories are
  removed).
- Execution stops at the first failed segment; no later segment runs.
- Previously committed segments are **not** globally rolled back. The target
  is left in a consistent partial state that is repaired by rerunning
  `agenticloop setup` or `agenticloop init`, which recomputes an idempotent
  plan over the partial state (a clean rerun plans zero mutations).
- Failures identify the committed segments, the failed segment, whether
  partial application occurred, the primary errors, and any rollback errors
  inside the failed segment. If an executor cannot confirm its rollback, the
  diagnostic says so explicitly and asks the user to inspect the target
  instead of claiming that the segment was restored.

## stdout and stderr

- Human results go to stdout; warnings and errors go to stderr.
- In JSON mode, stdout contains exactly one machine-readable document;
  prompts and progress are disabled and diagnostics use stderr.
- Default setup/init output reports step and mutation summaries. Individual
  planned/applied paths and detailed detection evidence require `--verbose`.

## `status --json` lifecycle orientation

`npx agenticloop status --json [--target <dir>]` emits one deterministic,
read-only, closed lifecycle-orientation snapshot. It is an orientation and
dispatch recommendation, not a mutation, activation grant, or proof that a host
execution occurred. The current schema is
`agenticloop.lifecycle-orientation` version `2`; unknown, missing, or extra
fields make the snapshot invalid.

For an otherwise clean files target with no task records, the shape is:

```json
{
  "kind": "agenticloop.lifecycle-orientation",
  "schemaVersion": 2,
  "state": "no_work",
  "target": "<absolute target path>",
  "backend": "files",
  "roots": { "carrier": ".agenticloop/tasks", "artifact": ".", "working": "<path>" },
  "activationScope": {
    "source": ".agenticloop/activations", "state": "current", "scopes": [], "errors": []
  },
  "operatorAuthorizedSet": {
    "source": "canonical_activation_resolution", "state": "current", "bindings": [], "errors": []
  },
  "adapters": { "adapters": [], "nextSteps": [] },
  "candidates": [],
  "excluded": [],
  "tasks": [],
  "diagnostics": [],
  "legalNextAction": { "type": "no_action", "taskId": null, "command": null }
}
```

The complete closed schema is:

- Top-level fields are exactly `kind`, `schemaVersion`, `state`, `target`,
  `backend`, `roots`, `activationScope`, `operatorAuthorizedSet`, `adapters`,
  `candidates`, `excluded`, `tasks`, `diagnostics`, and `legalNextAction`.
  `state` is `incomplete`, `no_work`, `one_candidate`, or
  `multiple_candidates`; `backend` is `files` or `github`.
- `roots` is exactly `{ carrier, artifact, working }`. `carrier` is a nonempty
  string; `artifact` is a string or `null`; `working` is a nonempty string for
  the top-level root and may be `null` on a task root.
- Each `tasks` and `candidates` entry is exactly `{ taskId, carrier, status,
  state, reasons, baseline, lint, activationProvenance, operatorAuthorization,
  roots, dependencies }`. `taskId` and `status` are strings or `null`; `carrier`
  is nonempty; `state` is `current` or `incomplete`; `reasons` is a string array;
  and `dependencies` is an array of `{ id, disposition }` nonempty-string pairs.
  `baseline` is exactly `{ state, digest, trustedRecordCount, errors }` with
  state `current`, `invalid`, or `unavailable`, a string-or-null digest, a
  nonnegative safe-integer trusted-record count, and string-array errors.
  `lint` is exactly `{ state, rootDiagnostics, errors }` with the same state
  vocabulary and string arrays. `activationProvenance` is exactly `{ state,
  inputDigest, captureRef }` with state `declared` or `missing` and
  string-or-null input digest and capture reference.
- `operatorAuthorization` is exactly `{ state, bindingId, grantId, provenance,
  errors }`. Its state is one of `present`, `missing`, `malformed`, `expired`,
  `revoked`, `stale`, `mismatched`, or `unauthenticated`; identifiers are
  strings or `null`, and errors are strings. A non-null `provenance` is exactly
  `{ repositoryIdentity, assurance, issuedAt, expiresAt, source, derivation,
  scope }`, where all fields other than `scope` are nonempty strings, assurance
  is `operator_confirmed` or `host_signed`, source is `activation_grant`, and
  scope is exactly one of `{ type: "exact_tasks", taskIds, workUnitId: null,
  operatorIntentDigest: null }` with nonempty unique sorted task-id strings,
  `{ type: "work_unit", taskIds: null, workUnitId, operatorIntentDigest: null
  }` with a nonempty work-unit id, or `{ type: "captured_request", taskIds:
  null, workUnitId: null, operatorIntentDigest }` with a nonempty intent digest.
- `activationScope` is exactly `{ source, state, scopes, errors }`, with source
  `.agenticloop/activations`, state `current` or `invalid`, and sorted `scopes`
  entries exactly `{ grantId, repositoryIdentity, assurance, scope }`.
  `operatorAuthorizedSet` is exactly `{ source, state, bindings, errors }`,
  with source `canonical_activation_resolution`, state `current` or `invalid`,
  and task-sorted bindings exactly `{ taskId, bindingId, grantId,
  repositoryIdentity, assurance, issuedAt, expiresAt, provenance }`; their
  provenance is exactly `{ source, derivation, scope }` and must agree with the
  corresponding task authorization.
- `adapters` is exactly `{ adapters, nextSteps }`. Each adapter is exactly
  `{ host, status, enabled, required, present, missingModelRoles }`, where the
  first two fields are strings, the next two are booleans, and the final two are
  string arrays. `nextSteps` is a string array. `diagnostics` is a string array.
  `excluded` has one entry for every non-candidate task and each entry is exactly
  `{ taskId, carrier, reason }`, with a string-or-null task id and nonempty
  carrier and reason strings.
- `legalNextAction` is exactly `{ type, taskId, command }`. It is
  `repair_lifecycle_context` with no task id, `no_action` with no task id and a
  null command, `prepare_dispatch` with a task id and an Engineer-role command,
  or `select_task` with no task id. Every legal action other than `no_action`
  has a nonempty command. For example, one current authorized `agent-ready`
  task yields `prepare_dispatch` and a command shaped as `agenticloop task
  prepare-dispatch <task-id> --host <host> --role engineer`.

The assurance model is intentionally narrow. `activationScope.scopes` reports
the authenticated grant's declared breadth, while
`operatorAuthorizedSet.bindings` reports only current, exact task authorization
resolved through the canonical activation policy. A broad grant scope is never
itself dispatch authorization. `present` therefore requires a current,
authenticated binding for the exact repository, backend, task, carrier, and
contract digest under effective policy. The snapshot exposes provenance and
diagnostics so callers can repair context, but it does not promote raw store
records, adapter capability, a digest, or a status message into authority.

## Handoff preflight and derived refresh

Use `npx agenticloop task handoff-preflight <task-id> --json` for one read-only
pre-delegation verdict. It reports the task carrier and protected contract as
separate identities, lifecycle dispatchability, current activation
authorization, readiness and decomposition evidence, host capability,
return-adapter resolution, active worktree state, relevant sibling collisions,
the disposition owner, and one safe repair command. When a consumed Engineer
attempt is live, it resolves the raw carrier lineage and reports the actual
next evidence/check step instead of a fresh-dispatch sequence. `proceed` means
the first reported command is executable against the identities shown; a
carrier mismatch fails first as `task.evidence.lineage.stale` with the exact
expected/current digests. Add
`--repair-plan <target-relative-path>` to write a
bounded plan for derived evidence only. Add `--host <host>` to evaluate a
specific host adapter, `--return-adapter <id>` to select a return adapter, and
`--output <path>` to write the result to a file.

### One preflight is the complete list of blockers

Preflight holds one property, and it is the reason to run it at all:

> A preflight that passes over a set of facts cannot be refused by packet
> preparation, prepared-packet validation, or role start over those same
> unchanged facts.

Activation is the one exception the property permits: preflight may report a
green result whose only outstanding item is the external operator action. Every
other prerequisite is reported here or it is a defect.

The property is enforced the only way it can be — by evaluating the same
dimensions with the same authorities, then checking the pair of verdicts over a
matrix of single-dimension mutations. Concretely:

| Dimension | Shared authority |
| --- | --- |
| Lifecycle | `evaluateDispatchableLifecycle`, derived from the legal-transition table |
| Relevant clean state | `evaluateDispatchCleanState` |
| Trusted contract baseline | committed append-only history from `loadFilesTaskContractRecords` |
| Committed decomposition | `validateDecomposition` |
| Work-unit membership | `validateParallelScanInventoryBinding` over a freshly enumerated inventory |

A dirty relevant checkout is an **error**, not an advisory: preflight and
`prepare-dispatch` call the same clean-state evaluator, so reporting it as a
warning here while refusing it there produced a green preflight and a blocked
dispatch over identical facts. Transient output under `.agenticloop/tmp/` and
operator-owned state are excluded by that evaluator at both boundaries, so
scratch never self-blocks the next gate; durable uncommitted evidence still
fails closed and has to be committed by the Maintainer first.

Preflight is permitted to refuse *earlier* than a later boundary would. The
property is one-directional: it forbids the false green, not the early refusal.

The `lifecycle` field answers one question preflight, packet preparation, and
role start all have to agree on: may this task begin an execution attempt right
now? The rule is derived from the single legal-transition authority rather than
restated, so a task is dispatchable exactly when its status can legally reach
`in-progress` — `agent-ready`, `in-progress`, `needs_revision`, `blocked`, or
`needs_context`. A `draft` task is refused here, with the Maintainer-owned
`task status <id> agent-ready` repair, instead of reaching a role start and
failing there as an illegal transition. An absent or unrecognized status is
reported as missing or malformed evidence, never as a negative answer.

Every lifecycle repair is rendered from one structured plan rather than
assembled as a string at each refusal site, so preflight, packet preparation,
prepared-packet validation, and role start cannot print different advice for the
same fact. The plan names the read-only command that supplies the current digest
(`task lint <id> --json`), one primary command whose declared placeholders are
the only tokens to replace, and — where the choice is genuinely the operator's —
one identified alternative with the condition that selects it. `--base` and
`--base-paths` are mutually exclusive, so they are never offered inside a single
command. Statuses with no safe forward move receive a statement of what is true
and no command at all.

Packet creation applies the whole rule, not part of it. `task prepare-dispatch`
refuses the terminal statuses `accepted` and `closed` exactly as preflight does,
so a caller that skips preflight cannot mint a packet for finished work. The
refusal carries the same diagnostic code and states the fact rather than
inventing a repair: a completed task has no remaining execution attempt to
authorize, and no operator action or packet remint reopens one. Dispatch a new
task instead.

Apply a plan explicitly with:

```text
npx agenticloop task refresh-handoff-receipt <task-id> --plan <path> --yes --json
```

The apply path is compare-before-write, atomic, and refetch-validated. Its write
surface is bounded to derived evidence under `.agenticloop/handoffs/derived-evidence/`,
the decomposition provenance under `.agenticloop/decompositions/`, and at most
one bound dependency snapshot — the exact path named by the decomposition's
`scan.readinessContext.dependencies.sourceRef`. It cannot change task contracts,
activation, human decisions, review dispositions, acceptance, closeout, or
product files. A durable Maintainer update is cooperative and must use the
emitted final trailer block; it does not authenticate the producer.
`refresh-handoff-evidence` remains a compatibility alias. A write returns
`written_pending_commit` and a non-proceed disposition until the exact changed
files are committed and a new preflight passes. Human and JSON output report
receipt state, decomposition regenerated/stale state, canonical commit subject
and trailers, and the exact next operation.

The dependency-observation category renews the observation *window*, not the
observation: it carries the Maintainer-recorded statuses forward unchanged and
re-stamps `observedAt`, resetting the `maxAgeSeconds` freshness window. It
verifies only that every declared dependency has a recorded status; it does not
re-observe dependency state, so the Maintainer remains responsible for those
statuses still being currently true.

#### Why the freshness window differs by backend

`task prepare-decomposition` chooses its default `maxAgeSeconds` by asking one
question: **can a dependency status change without producing an observable
repository event?**

| Backend | Default | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `files` | 86,400s (the trusted maximum) | No. Dependency statuses are task records inside the repository, and the scan already binds inventory membership, each carrier digest, the protected contract, the base tree, and the dependency snapshot's provenance. A real change breaks a binding and is refused semantically at preflight and at dispatch, so the clock is only a backstop. |
| `github` | 3,600s | Yes. Issue state lives outside the repository and can change with no local event, so nothing local would notice. There the clock is the only mechanism and stays short. |

`--max-age-seconds` overrides either default, and a window an observation
already declared is part of that evidence: changing the default never
retroactively widens an existing observation.

The previous flat 3,600-second default applied the GitHub answer to both
backends. On a files route it measured how long the Engineer session took rather
than whether the evidence was stale, so any run over an hour expired before it
could produce a return — with nothing having changed.

The bound set is the status set for **declared** dependencies. A status recorded
for a task this one does not depend on is not a material change, and does not
invalidate readiness. Over-invalidation is a defect in the same way a false
green is.

`commit-attribution check` accepts `--role orchestrator|maintainer|engineer|auditor`.
The role is validated against the canonical registry and the final contiguous
`Task:`/`Agent:` trailer parser is shared with decomposition verification. The
`Agent:` trailer value must be the exact lowercase canonical `roleId` (the
immutable lowercase machine identity); capitalized spellings such as
`Agent: Engineer` are rejected as a wrong trailer. This is a deliberate
tightening over 0.4.1, which lowercased the trailer before comparing.

## GitHub review audit

Use `agenticloop github-review-audit --pr <number>` to validate the current
artifact-bound review outcome for a pull request. Add
`--expect-status needs_revision` when validating a revision request instead of
acceptance. For a dispatched review, add
`--expect-artifact <complete-git-object-identity>` to require that both the PR
head and review marker still match the dispatched artifact. If a local review
checkout is supplied, add `--workspace <path>` as well; it requires
`--expect-artifact` and rejects a workspace whose Git HEAD does not match that
exact identity.

Every identity on this path uses the one canonical complete Git object identity
rule: a lowercase 40-character SHA-1 or 64-character SHA-256 object id.
Abbreviated and uppercase identities are rejected, and a single
repository-bound claim - PR head, workspace head, expected artifact, review
marker artifact, commit inventory, and Maintainer fixup base/result artifacts -
must use one object format throughout.

The audit also binds versioned marker attribution to its authenticated source:
`AGENT_REVIEW_ACTOR_ACCOUNT` must equal the authenticated GitHub login that
published the carrier (compared case-insensitively, preserved verbatim), and
`[[agent: maintainer]]` must be the final live nonblank line of the carrier.

## Review preparation lifecycle

Use this read-only lifecycle for GitHub-backed work:

```text
pr-body scaffold/lint -> github-preflight -> github-review-prepare
-> Maintainer review -> github-review-audit -> github-ready
```

`pr-body scaffold --pr <n> [--output <path>] [--snapshot-output <path>]` reads
current GitHub state read-only and renders a deliberately incomplete local
body. Run it only after the final implementation push and required checks: the
captured head and context are exact, and a later push invalidates the authoring
packet (rerun the checks and re-scaffold/revalidate rather than refreshing
markers). Both outputs are written atomically and missing parent directories
are created. Exit 0 means the scaffold was generated successfully; the result
is `generated: true` with `lintReady: false` and `gatePassed: false`, so it is
never reported as publication-ready. Output reports both written paths and the
exact next lint command.

Replace every `REPLACE` field in the Markdown draft, then lint the local body
before publishing through one of three mutually exclusive modes:

- Live (primary): `pr-body lint --pr <n> --body-file <path>` loads the same
  live read-only context as preflight, replaces only the in-memory candidate
  body with the local file, injects the live task/decision reference resolvers,
  and never writes GitHub.
- Offline: `pr-body lint --snapshot <path> --body-file <path>` performs zero
  network access against a CLI-authored
  `agenticloop.pr-body-context` snapshot (`snapshotSchemaVersion: 1`, capture
  time, repository, PR, issue, head, base, fixed review mode, the complete
  nested preparation input, and materialized task/decision reference
  inventories). Snapshot kind, version, provenance, and internal identity are
  validated; the nested remote `prData.body` is context-only and is always
  replaced by `--body-file`. Snapshot success is bound to the complete captured
  context, not to later live state.
- Compatibility (deprecated): `pr-body lint --input <evaluation-input.json>`
  retains its serialized preparation-input JSON semantics, emits a deprecation
  diagnostic in human output, `warnings`, and `warningDiagnostics`, and rejects
  Markdown with a targeted Engineer-owned error. It never checks live state and
  cannot be combined with `--pr`, `--snapshot`, `--body-file`, `--issue`, or
  `--repo`. The live-only `--issue` and `--repo` options are also rejected with
  `--snapshot`.

Live and snapshot lint fix evaluation `mode: review` and share the same
evaluator, so equivalent context and body produce equivalent results. Lint
rejects an incomplete input category instead of silently skipping evidence,
history, attribution, status, base-tree, or reference checks, and incomplete
context is reported as `inputComplete: false` with `gateEvaluated: false`
rather than as a failed semantic gate. Lint is structural, not a placeholder
grep: it validates the required sections, the exact current-head marker and
implementation artifact, every required check with an allowed kind/source and a
final verdict, substantive structured observation evidence, current resolution
entries, and the final Engineer attribution. Results report `contextMode`
(`live`, `snapshot`, or `legacy`), repository/PR/issue/head/base provenance,
`inputComplete`, `bodyLintEvaluated`, `gateEvaluated`, `lintReady`,
  `gatePassed`, and `publicationReady`, plus merged errors, warnings,
  diagnostics, error-only failure categories, owner routing, first safe repair,
  and an exact repair-aligned PR-body-scoped `nextCommand` when one is
  mechanically known. Conflicting or missing mode options exit `2`; missing
  files, malformed JSON, wrong snapshot kind/version, provenance mismatches,
  incomplete input, stale evidence, and failed lint/gates exit `1`; a
  publication-ready lint exits `0`.

After a publication-ready lint, publish explicitly (for example
`gh pr edit <n> --body-file <path>`), then run live `github-preflight` and
`github-review-prepare`. `github-review-prepare` evaluates published live
state; it is never the unpublished-draft linter.

Required-check task policy is validated before either PR-body or status-check
satisfaction. Invalid kinds or sources, command proofs without an exact
backticked command, status-check satisfaction for a non-command proof, and
status-check-only observation contracts are routed to the Maintainer.

The `scaffolded` field reports canonical scaffold shape/provenance (including
the distinctive Changed Paths section); it does not mean the body remains
incomplete. Use `lintReady` and `publicationReady` for readiness.

`github-preflight` remains the low-level live evidence gate. Run
`github-review-prepare --pr <n>` only after it passes. Preparation emits a
schema-v3 Maintainer packet only when `result.ok === true` for one final complete
snapshot and a current verified Engineer return is bound to the exact durable
dispatch consumption. No return chain means no packet and no lifecycle-bearing
receipt. The packet requires a closed, digest-bound review-entry receipt for
that task, contract, checks, review history, attribution, workspace, and exact
head, plus an exact immutable read-only lease and whole-packet digest; a
matching head never overrides a failed result. Failed preparation emits
a typed resume packet routed to the capability-derived diagnostic owner and does
not invoke a reviewer. Any bound input change invalidates the packet.

`github-review-audit` is post-review provenance validation. `github-ready` is
the post-acceptance, pre-merge composite and reuses the same preflight evaluator.

Packet checking has two distinct levels, and only one of them proves current
repository state:

- **Structural and digest validation** proves the packet is a complete
  closed-schema packet whose embedded review-entry receipt is a complete
  digest-consistent
  schema-v3 receipt with a valid `agenticloop.review-entry-receipt.v3` digest,
  and that no duplicated outer field contradicts that receipt: PR, task, exact
  head, task-contract digest and baseline, review mode,
  `independentReviewRequired`, required-check count, evidence-match count,
  current finding IDs derived from the receipt's durable review history, and the
  workspace head when a workspace is present. It performs no refetch, so it does
  **not** prove the packet is current. A fabricated receipt that only echoes a
  matching head and task is rejected here.
- **Current-state verification** with
  `github-review-prepare --pr <n> --packet <path>` is the authoritative
  pre-dispatch consumer. It applies the structural check, refetches the complete
  current PR/task state, re-evaluates preflight, revalidates the complete
  receipt against that state, compares the evaluated head with the current head,
  re-recognizes the current stored return against its consumed dispatch,
  and rejects stale, missing, malformed, fabricated, and self-contradictory
  packets. When the packet records a workspace, this level also reruns Git
  identity verification at that exact path and rejects path or HEAD
  substitution. Only this level may claim current dispatch readiness.

Malformed JSON or an invalid packet schema fails locally without contacting
GitHub. Preparation
itself also evaluates workspace and independent-review policy from the final
snapshot then compares its evaluated head with the immediately refetched head,
so a head that moves during preparation yields only a stale-head diagnostic that
names both compared identities. None of
these commands posts, edits, requests review, accepts, merges, amends, pushes,
or force-pushes.

Every review-preparation gate supports `--json`. Normal, usage, loader, and operational
failures use a versioned envelope with diagnostics, categories, ownership, and a
first safe repair; human output is rendered from the same result.

## Activation and implementation dispatch

All five shipped generators (OpenCode, Claude Code, Codex, Copilot, and Cursor)
fill the shared activation slots with a stable adapter ID and the typed
capability `unsupported`. Their request text is model-visible and does not
establish a lossless parser-owned byte artifact. Generated activation surfaces
therefore contain no `$ARGUMENTS`, `$1`, or `$2` capture claims, never ask a
model to create capture JSON, and never grant activation from inside a session.
This is an intentional fail-closed state and it does not change.

### `agenticloop activate`

The universal, host-neutral activation path. No host plugin, no host
integration, and no change to any existing task:

```text
npx agenticloop activate T-016 T-017
npx agenticloop activate --work-unit phase:4
npx agenticloop activate T-016 --dry-run
```

The command prints the exact tasks, carriers, contract digests, repository, work
unit, and resulting assurance, then requires you to type `activate` to confirm.
It **refuses non-interactive invocation and refuses to run under CI**, and there
is deliberately no `--yes`: a flag that let an agent mint this grade silently
would erase the only thing separating it from an unsigned repository file.

Options: `--work-unit <id>` (mutually exclusive with explicit task ids),
`--expires-in-hours <n>` (default 12, maximum 168), `--repo <owner/name>` for
the GitHub backend, `--dry-run`, `--json`, `--target <dir>`.

Exit statuses: 0 on activation, dry run, or operator cancellation; 1 on refusal
or write failure; 2 on invalid usage.

Both backends are supported through their canonical identity and digest loaders.
Nothing rewrites a task body: task ids, frontmatter, history, and decomposition
state are preserved, so **existing tasks and projects never need recreation.**

A work-unit activation derives child bindings only from current committed
Maintainer-attributed decomposition evidence, and only for canonical ready-set
members. For existing tasks without suitable decomposition evidence, name the
task ids directly.

Records are written as one transaction under `.agenticloop/activations/`:
either the grant and every binding land, or none do and the versioned mutation
receipt says so. A failed multi-task activation therefore produces no partial
authority.

### Task materialization producer

```text
npx agenticloop task materialize T-020 --source <plan.json> --package <work-package-id> \
  --judgment <maintainer-judgment.json> --yes --json
```

The source has a required `sourceRevision` and a `workPackages` array. Selection
must match exactly one package. Source traceability, planner-contract bullets,
locked decision IDs, grouping metadata, and the standard task templates are
copied deterministically; current state, scope/out-of-scope, acceptance,
expected files, parallel safety, implementation notes, and required checks come
only from the Maintainer judgment file. The draft binds source revision and the
SHA-256 digest of the exact source bytes and is validated against the ordinary
task-record contract before its one create-only write.

### Sanitized toolkit escalation proposal

```text
npx agenticloop improvement propose-toolkit-escalation \
  --input <closed-facts.json> --toolkit-repository <identity> \
  --output .agenticloop/tmp/<name>.toolkit-proposal.json --yes --json
```

This is a human-confirmed export, not an import and not an external write. The
closed input permits only Agentic Loop version, command, diagnostic codes,
affected toolkit surface, durable references, and reproduction steps. Local
paths, session identifiers, and credential-shaped text are redacted; raw
transcript/private-content fields are refused. The receiving identity remains
operator-asserted external evidence and must be recreated/imported under the
toolkit repository's own durable evidence.

### Readiness plan

```text
npx agenticloop task readiness-plan <task-id> [--actor <git-author>] [--authority <kind:reference>]
                                              [--work-unit <id>] [--base <ref> | --base-paths <path>]
                                              [--dependencies <path>] [--json]
```

For one bounded sibling set:

```text
npx agenticloop task readiness-plan --tasks T-020 T-021 T-022 \
  --work-unit milestone:M01 --actor "<git-author>" --authority "<kind:reference>" \
  --base <ref> --dependencies-by-task .agenticloop/tmp/M01-dependencies.json --json
```

Read-only. It computes the **whole** readiness sequence at once, in dependency
order, from current facts — instead of letting the Maintainer discover one
prerequisite per failed gate.

That discovery loop is what the field record measured: 23 of 29 preflights and
18 of 31 dispatch attempts failed, because each prerequisite was found by
failing a gate, repaired, and then invalidated by the repair after it. The
prerequisites were never wrong; they were only ever presented one at a time.

Steps, in order: `task_contract`, `trusted_contract_baseline`,
`dependency_observation`, `work_unit_identity`, `committed_decomposition`,
`maintainer_attribution`, `lifecycle_agent_ready`. Each reports whether it is
settled, what it depends on, its owner (always the Maintainer), and — where the
command is derivable from current state — the exact command with the current
HEAD and any supplied `--actor`/`--authority` already substituted.

The plan shows its **complete write set before anything is written**, naming
only real paths; a placeholder in a write set would defeat the point. Every
write is workflow or task evidence, never a product file, and the plan names one
final Maintainer-attributed commit.

Lint, plan, and apply use the same authoring readiness evaluator. Warnings are
non-blocking but remain in human/JSON diagnostics and in `planDigest`. Errors
make the plan inapplicable, name stable codes and affected paths/dependencies,
and print exact `task-readiness` diagnosis and plan-regeneration commands.

**It never plans activation**, and says so rather than leaving it to omission.
Activation is the operator action that *follows* readiness — planning it here
would reintroduce the exact ordering the field session got wrong. A settled plan
exits zero; an unsettled one exits non-zero with the remaining steps.

A per-task `work-unit:<task-id>` fallback is reported as *not* a durable work
unit, so the grouping confusion is caught at authoring time rather than at
activation.

#### Display-only and executable plans

A plan produced from current facts alone is **display-only**: `applicable` is
`false` and `blockers` lists the exact inputs it lacks. Supply every apply input
— `--actor`, `--authority`, `--work-unit`, exactly one of `--base`/`--base-paths`,
and `--dependencies` — and the plan becomes **executable**: `applicable` is
`true`, `blockers` is empty, and the plan additionally binds `expectedHead`,
`expectedTaskDigest`, the repository authority identity, the resolved base tree,
the committed dependency snapshot and its source commit, the observed task
inventory, the exact write set with each path's expected predecessor state
(`absent` or an exact digest), `finalCommitMessage`, `activationPlanned: false`,
and a `planDigest` over the whole closed plan.

Nothing in the plan is a wall clock or a random id, so repeating it over
unchanged facts produces byte-identical output. That is what makes `planDigest`
usable as a staleness test.

The actor, the authority, and the work-unit identity are never fabricated. If
the current contract differs from its trusted baseline, the plan blocks and
points at `task authorize-correction`; readiness never invents a correction or a
human authority. An existing activation is left untouched and is never treated as
authorization for readiness mutation — the plan states that readiness mutation may
make an old task binding stale and that activation is evaluated again afterwards.

### Readiness apply

```text
npx agenticloop task readiness-apply [<compatible-task-id>] --plan <path> (--dry-run | --yes) [--json]
```

Maintainer-owned mutation. It consumes one reviewed **executable** plan and
settles the whole sequence as a single transaction: one filesystem batch through
the shared mutation kernel, then **at most one** Maintainer-attributed commit.

`readiness-plan` removed the discovery loop. This removes the execution loop:
settling readiness by hand meant `establish-baseline`, a commit,
`prepare-decomposition` redirected to a file, `task status agent-ready`, and a
second commit — and a repair in the middle could invalidate what an earlier
command had already produced.

The two-phase flow:

```text
npx agenticloop task readiness-plan T-018 \
  --actor "<git-author>" --authority "<kind:reference>" \
  --work-unit "milestone:M2" --base "<ref>" \
  --dependencies ".agenticloop/dependencies/T-018.json" \
  --json > .agenticloop/tmp/T-018-readiness-plan.json

npx agenticloop task readiness-apply T-018 --plan .agenticloop/tmp/T-018-readiness-plan.json --dry-run --json
npx agenticloop task readiness-apply T-018 --plan .agenticloop/tmp/T-018-readiness-plan.json --yes    --json
```

A work-unit plan uses the same apply commands without a positional task id. It
validates the complete canonical task set, calculates all prospective carrier
digests, overlays them into one final inventory, evaluates each inventory member
with its own bound dependency evidence, and writes all baselines,
decompositions, and carrier transitions in one compare-before-write batch. The
one commit is `chore(<work-unit>): settle readiness` with exact `Work-Unit`,
ordered `Tasks`, and `Agent: maintainer` trailers. A single-task commit is
`chore(<task>): settle readiness`. Reordered, duplicate, missing, or unrelated
task attribution fails closed.

That reviewed work-unit plan is indivisible. If any member has a live consumed
Engineer attempt, `--yes` refuses the entire set before mutation, reports the
blocking task and all plan members, and states that partial sibling apply is
unsupported. Applying only the apparently free siblings would change the
shared prospective inventory the plan binds. Finish or explicitly retire the
live attempt, then regenerate and review the work-unit plan.

`--dry-run` and `--yes` are mutually exclusive and one is required: mutation is
never implicit. A dry run performs every validation that does not require
writing. The plan file is transient scratch and belongs under
`.agenticloop/tmp/`.

Apply never executes a command string copied from the plan. It consumes the
plan's structured facts and calls the same source functions the standalone
commands call, so the two routes cannot accept different evidence.

Before writing anything it parses the plan against a closed schema (unknown
fields and unsupported versions fail closed), verifies `planDigest`, verifies the
task, backend, repository authority and root, then **re-resolves every bound
input** — base evidence, the committed dependency snapshot, the task inventory —
recomputes the plan, and compares it. A moved HEAD, a changed carrier digest, a
changed status, damaged trusted history, a refreshed dependency snapshot, changed
inventory membership, or a changed predecessor path state each refuse with one
root cause and one safe repair.

Repository safety is conservative:

- any staged entry is refused — including force-staged scratch under
  `.agenticloop/tmp/` — so nothing already in the index can ride along;
- unrelated tracked or untracked changes are refused;
- a planned path whose bytes the plan did not bind is refused;
- only untracked or unstaged transient scratch under `.agenticloop/tmp/` is
  permitted; a staged scratch entry is refused like any other staged change;
- a detached HEAD is refused; a named branch is required;
- Git hooks and signing policy are never bypassed, and `git add -A` is never used.

A refusal resets, restores, and discards nothing: the unsafe state is reported
and the operator decides. Bounded restoration exists only on this transaction's
own failures (see the exact-tree and rollback paragraphs below) and touches only
operation-owned paths and their index entries — no broad or destructive reset
is performed anywhere.

The write set is workflow evidence only and is at most three paths: the
task-contract history append, the decomposition source, and the task carrier. A
product path and an activation path can never enter it. The decomposition is
prepared over the **prospective** carrier — the agent-ready bytes the same commit
introduces — so the committed decomposition is not stale against its own commit.

Staging is one literal pathspec per planned path, the staged set is compared
with the planned set, and the exact staged tree is captured from the verified
index before the commit. Commit and rollback ownership are bound to the
reviewed branch: the full symbolic ref and its OID are captured immediately
before `git commit`, and after every hook has run the *reviewed ref* — never
ambient HEAD, which a hook may have switched — must hold exactly one new
commit directly above the expected HEAD. The commit is an ordinary
`git commit`, so every configured hook runs and signing policy applies
unchanged. The one owned commit must then carry the captured tree and the
reviewed message; a hook that stages an unplanned path (a product file above
all) or rewrites planned bytes makes it this transaction's own invalid commit,
which is rolled back by a compare-and-swap ref update that moves only if the
ref still points at it, with per-path index restoration and exact predecessor
restoration — reported `rolled_back`. Everything else is preserved and
reported `unresolved`: a post-commit hook that adds another commit (changed-
tree or same-tree), a hook that switches branches (the other branch is never
rewound), a ref that moves between detection and rollback, or a compare-and-
swap refusal. No commit outside the one this transaction created is ever
rewritten, and receipt heads and commit counts are derived from the actual
post-state.

After the commit, apply refetches from actual HEAD and re-runs the ordinary
production gates: the readiness plan, the trusted chain, committed-source and
Maintainer-attribution verification for the decomposition and the dependency
snapshot, the canonical preflight, and a clean worktree check. If any of them
refuses, the result is `unresolved` and readiness is not claimed. A commit
whose exact tree and message are valid but whose canonical verification refuses
is preserved, never reset or rewritten automatically.

**It never activates.** `activationPlanned` and `activationCreated` are both
`false` in every receipt, and on success `nextAction` names activation as the
separate operator action that follows.

The JSON receipt reports `planDigest`, `expectedHead`, `resultingHead`,
`priorTaskDigest`, `resultingTaskDigest`, `changedPaths`, `commit`, `commitCount`,
readiness state, and `mutationDisposition`:

| disposition | meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `already_current` | the task is already ready by proof (see below); nothing was written and no commit was created |
| `committed` | one Maintainer readiness commit settled the sequence |
| `dry_run` | every possible validation passed; nothing was written |
| `stale` | a bound input changed since the plan was reviewed, or a consumed plan's readiness commit is no longer HEAD |
| `blocked` | the plan, the candidates, or the repository state refuse the transaction |
| `rolled_back` | a failure before or at the commit boundary restored the exact predecessor state — including this transaction's own hook-contaminated commit, undone by a compare-and-swap ref update |
| `partially_committed` | the filesystem batch failed and rollback reported errors |
| `unresolved` | the outcome could not be proved; every ref and commit is preserved — additional hook-created commits, a switched branch, or an unproved rollback all land here |

Rerunning is safe, and `already_current` is a proven state with exactly two
forms. A freshly regenerated ready plan (empty write set) is `already_current`
only while its digest and bound facts still match. A consumed plan is
`already_current` only while HEAD is still its exact readiness commit — the
commit directly above the plan's expected HEAD, carrying the reviewed message
and exactly the planned paths. Both forms still pass current applicability (a
detached HEAD blocks even a no-op), repository safety (staged or unrelated dirt
blocks even a no-op), and the canonical committed verification. Any later HEAD
movement makes a consumed plan `stale` — regenerate it rather than reuse it —
and activation guidance is never attached to a stale, blocked, or unsafe
result.

**GitHub is unsupported.** `readiness-apply` is declared files-only because no
equivalent transactional carrier exists there. Invoking it with the GitHub
backend returns the standard typed unsupported-backend result rather than a
partial cross-carrier orchestration. The files and GitHub *semantic* readiness
rules remain aligned.

### Operational measurement

```text
npx agenticloop task measure <task-id> [--json]
```

Read-only, and it **persists nothing**. Every counter is derived on demand from
evidence that already exists for its own reasons — consumption records,
abandonment records, carrier mutation receipts. That is how the rule
*telemetry is not task evidence and must not become a second workflow truth
store* is kept: there is no second store to drift from the first, and deleting
the output loses nothing. The result states `derived: true`, `persisted: false`,
`authority: "none"` so a reader who finds it on disk knows what it is.

It is privacy-clean by construction, not by policy. The inputs are identities,
counts, and instants; the reader never opens a task body, a commit message, or
an abandonment's stated reason, and the projection has no field to hold one.

Reported counters: execution attempts, abandoned attempts, packet remints,
distinct product bases, and carrier mutations. Durations are reported only where
both endpoints are durable evidence — a stage whose start or end exists only in
a transcript is **absent rather than estimated**, because an invented duration
is not a measurement.

Deviations from the ordinary shape (one attempt, none abandoned, one product
base) are reported, never enforced. A missed target is a fact for a human to
weigh. Two attempts against the *same* base is a retry; two against different
bases means work was rebuilt on a base the earlier packet never described, and
the counters keep that distinction.

Unreadable evidence is named rather than counted as zero, and the command exits
non-zero: a measurement that reads a broken store as "nothing happened" is worse
than no measurement, because it looks like a clean run.

### Owner routing

Every typed failure returns to the role that owns the repair, and the routing is
*derived* rather than declared at each site: `REPAIR_POLICY` maps a diagnostic
code to a repair kind, and `agents/*.md` frontmatter binds each repair kind to
exactly one primary owner. Evaluators report facts and never name a role.

The boundary that matters in practice is that an Engineer cannot be handed
Maintainer-owned work from inside its own run. These categories always route to
the Maintainer: `task_contract` (lifecycle, baseline, record structure),
`task_identity`, `task_policy`, `path_intent` (scope and base inventory),
`generated_paths`, `parallel_scan` (decomposition and its inventory),
`review_checkpoint`, `review_provenance`, and `review_audit`.

Decomposition is in that list because `task prepare-decomposition` is
Maintainer-owned authoring and its committed source must carry Maintainer
attribution to be accepted — so an Engineer regenerating it inside its own run
could never produce a source that dispatch would take.

Two adjacent repair kinds read alike and are deliberately split:
`repair_attribution_trailer` is the Engineer fixing its own commit trailer;
`repair_task_attribution` is Maintainer-owned task-record provenance.

A second, independent layer backs this up: `ROLE_ALLOWED_ACTIONS` withholds the
`task_workflow_mutate` action class from the Engineer entirely, so even a
misrouted repair cannot be carried out. Human-authority escalations resolve to
the human boundary and never to an agent role.

### Historical adoption

```text
npx agenticloop task adopt-historical <task-id>   --artifact <commit> --integration <kind:reference> --integration-commit <commit>   --audit <kind:reference> --authority <kind:reference> --reason <text>   --missing <class> [--missing <class>...] [--json]
```

Some accepted, integrated, auditable work predates dispatch packets and verified
returns. It cannot satisfy normal closeout, and there are only three ways to
respond: re-waive the missing evidence (which devalues normal closeout for every
task), synthesize it (which is the one thing the evidence model exists to
prevent), or give that work its own terminal result that says exactly what it
is. This is the third.

**An adoption is not a closeout.** It reaches `historical_adoption_accepted`
with assurance `historical_reduced` — a status distinct from every canonical
lifecycle status, and a grade below every canonical one — so a reader can tell
the difference without consulting a second record. Files and GitHub project the
identical verdict, including `canonicalClosure: false`.

It requires, in place of the evidence it lacks:

| Input | Why |
| --- | --- |
| the exact **current** task contract | the thing adopted is the thing on disk now |
| `--artifact` | an accepted implementation commit, as a real Git object |
| `--integration` / `--integration-commit` | proof the artifact actually landed |
| `--audit` | an independent audit naming that exact artifact |
| `--authority` / `--reason` | reduced assurance is a decision a person makes |
| `--missing` | every evidence class this task genuinely lacks |

`--missing` accepts only recognized classes — `dispatch_packet`,
`dispatch_consumption`, `carrier_mutation_lineage`, `verified_return`,
`host_return_receipt`, `activation_grant` — and at least one is required: a task
missing nothing belongs in normal closeout. The record has nowhere to put a
packet, consumption, return, receipt, or activation, so none can be smuggled in,
and a task that already has dispatch consumption evidence is refused outright
rather than downgraded.

Normal closeout is unchanged for every task that entered the canonical
lifecycle.

### Execution attempts and packet conservation

```text
npx agenticloop task attempt-status <task-id> [--json]
npx agenticloop task abandon-attempt <task-id> --attempt <attempt-id> --reason <text> --authority <kind:reference> [--json]
```

A dispatch packet is not a ticket that can be reissued. It is the evidence that
one execution attempt started from one product base, and once an Engineer has
mutated anything under it, that packet is the only thing that can still explain
what the mutation was relative to.

So a consumed packet **reaches a canonical return or is explicitly abandoned**.
`task prepare-dispatch` applies the rule before minting a new packet:

| State | New packet |
| --- | --- |
| No attempt has been consumed | permitted |
| A live attempt exists and has recorded no Engineer mutation | permitted — nothing was built against the old base |
| A live attempt exists and has recorded Engineer mutations | **refused** |
| The previous attempt was explicitly abandoned | permitted, with the abandoned attempt still on record |

The last unit of `attempt_budget` is spent explicitly. When minting would open
the final attempt the budget allows, `task prepare-dispatch` refuses under
`dispatch.attempt.final_slot_unacknowledged` and names the consequence: after
that attempt no further packet can be minted until the budget is raised or the
task is recorded as blocked. Re-run with `--acknowledge-final-attempt` to
proceed. The acknowledgement is spent on the invocation that makes it - it
records nothing, grants no additional authority, and carries no scope or expiry
a later command could read back. Exhaustion itself remains a separate refusal,
`dispatch.attempt.budget_exhausted`; a budget about to be spent is not a
budget already spent.

If human authority decides the budget is genuinely too low, edit only
`attempt_budget` in the task carrier and commit that carrier-only change.
`attempt_budget` is outside the protected task contract, so this does not use
`task authorize-correction`. The edit is permitted only when no attempt is
live: complete the live attempt, or explicitly retire it with `task
abandon-attempt`, before changing the budget.

Re-validating an existing packet with `task prepare-dispatch <id> --packet
<path>` remains a pre-role-start diagnostic. Do not run it after consumption:
role start deliberately advances the repository/carrier, so recomputing the
unconsumed packet binding then is stale by construction. `task role-start`
performs the authoritative full revalidation immediately before mutation.

The attempt identity is derived from the consumption that started it — its
packet, invocation, and product base — rather than minted alongside it, so it
cannot drift from the evidence it names. Two consumptions that share a packet id
but not a product base are **not** the same attempt, which is exactly why a
packet minted after product work can never be read as proof of the original
base.

`attempt-status` lists every attempt with its packet, product base, consumption
instant, state, and — for abandoned attempts — the stated reason and authority.
It exits non-zero when a new packet is not permitted.

`abandon-attempt` is the explicit escape, and the refusal names it verbatim. It
requires a stated `--reason` and a durable `--authority` reference: discarding
execution evidence is an operator decision, so it is recorded as one. It refuses
an attempt that is not recorded or is already closed, and it never deletes the
abandoned attempt or its evidence.

Unreadable consumption, abandonment, or carrier-mutation evidence fails closed.
"I cannot read this abandonment" is never treated as "there is no abandonment",
because that direction silently re-enables the reminting the rule prevents.
Schema-v1 execution-attempt abandonment records remain historical evidence but
are incompatible with the current schema-v2 lifecycle gate. They are not
migrated or relabeled; create a fresh current attempt and use `task
abandon-attempt` with current authority if that attempt must be terminated.

The ledger also checks that the history each attempt names still exists. A
recorded product base that Git can no longer reach, a base that is no longer an
ancestor of the current head, or a live `git replace` mapping means the attempt
range was rewritten, and `attempt-status` refuses with a **Maintainer-owned**
repair rather than letting the rewrite be discovered after the fact. The role
that rewrote the history is exactly the role that cannot authorize the rewrite.

### Resuming an attempt whose product work is already committed

When a task's product work was committed under an attempt that was then
explicitly abandoned, the protocol's own recovery steps — the abandonment
receipt, the regenerated decomposition, the fresh packet, the role-start carrier
mutation — each add a workflow commit on top of that work. Two rules used to
make the resumed return impossible: the implementation artifact had to be
exactly `HEAD`, and an implementation-ready return needed a non-empty product
range derived from Git.

Both are now derived facts rather than positions:

- **The product head is derived, and scoped to the task.** `task evidence
  --class implementation_artifact_evidence --product-head <commit>` accepts
  `HEAD` or any ancestor of it, provided no path inside the task's
  `allowed_paths` changed after that commit and the commit itself changes at
  least one path inside them. Both questions are asked about the surface the
  task declares, because a repository anyone else also commits to always
  acquires one more shared path - a lockfile, a target config file, a
  coworker's commit - and asking whether anything anywhere changed after the
  artifact left a finished implementation permanently unbindable. Re-passing the
  head the record already binds is accepted as a no-op and reported as already
  current. `task lint` asks the same question of the same surface and refuses an
  `implementation_artifact` that carries no work on it, so the field can never
  point at a role-start receipt while the implementation sits earlier.
- **The product base is carried, explicitly.** A product-mutating terminal
  attempt contributes lineage. A valid same-task recovery record that proves no
  product mutation preserves continuity only when it is `tooling_failed` or a
  `superseded_*` disposition. A live attempt, plain no-product abandonment,
  terminal conflict, malformed record, or unrelated history ends the walk. A
  no-product-only history yields no lineage. A return across an unbroken run
  binds the earliest product-contributing attempt's base and states the claim
  in `productLineage`, naming each traversed attempt. The claim
  is derived from durable dispatch-consumption and abandonment records, and the
  verification boundary re-derives it from the same records and reproves the
  ancestry against Git before accepting the return. An ordinary attempt carries
  nothing and `productLineage` is `null`.

Carry compatibility is independent of budget classification. In particular,
workflow-recovery dispositions do not consume engineering budget;
`tooling_failed` consumes it only when the closed abandonment record proves a
product mutation. No disposition must be rewritten to plain `abandoned`.

### `agenticloop task commit-message`

```text
npx agenticloop task commit-message <task-id> --class <implementation_artifact_evidence|attempt_abandonment|...> --subject <text> [--body <text> | --body-file <path>] --output <message-file> [--json]
```

Agentic Loop requires `Task:` and `Agent:` in the final contiguous trailer block
of a commit message. `git commit -m … -m …` — the most natural way to write a
multi-line message — inserts a blank line between every `-m`, which strands
`Task:` in its own paragraph and produces a message the toolkit rejects. This is
the producer that emits a compliant message file; commit it with `git commit -F
<message-file>`, never with repeated `-m` arguments.

The **commit class decides the attributed role**, so no role has to guess it:

| Class | Agent |
| --- | --- |
| `product_implementation`, `role_start_status`, `implementation_artifact_evidence`, `implementation_summary_evidence`, `implementation_outcome_evidence` | `engineer` |
| `attempt_abandonment`, `handoff_evidence_refresh`, `readiness_settlement`, `review_record`, `acceptance_transition` | `maintainer` |
| `audit_record` | `auditor` |

The producer and the `commit-attribution check` validator share one renderer, so
a message this command emits can never be one the validator rejects, and every
refusal that reports a trailer defect names this command as its repair.

### `agenticloop activation`

```text
npx agenticloop activation status [<task-id>] [--json]
npx agenticloop activation revoke <grant-id> [--reason <text>] [--json]
npx agenticloop activation provision-key [--json]
npx agenticloop activation identity-status [--json]
npx agenticloop activation migrate-identity [--json]
```

`status` reports every stored binding, whether it is still usable against
current task state, and the effective policy with its source. `revoke` creates
an externally authoritative repository-specific create-only tombstone; every binding derived from that grant is then refused
by dispatch. `provision-key` creates the external operator confirmation key
explicitly; `activate` provisions it lazily, so running it separately is
optional.

#### Repository authority identity and migration

Operator activation keys and external revocation tombstones live outside the
target repository, addressed by a digest of the target's **repository authority
identity**. That derivation is versioned, because changing it relocates every
existing record:

| Version | Derivation |
| --- | --- |
| v1 | `file:` plus the host's resolved path, separators normalized, host letter case preserved |
| v2 (current) | v1 plus Windows case folding, so `C:\Apps\Repo` and `c:\apps\repo` are one identity |

On POSIX the two versions agree and nothing below applies.

`identity-status` is read-only. It reports the current identity and digest, the
state of the current operator key, and every superseded spelling that still
holds operator state:

```text
npx agenticloop activation identity-status
Repository authority identity v2: file:c:/apps/example
  digest:            2f1c...e90a
  operator key:      missing
  disposition:       migration_available
  superseded:        file:C:/apps/example [key present, 2 revocation(s)]
    digest:          9b74...31cd
    revocations:     C:\Users\you\.agenticloop\operator-activation\revocations\9b74...31cd
```

Both output modes report the digest of every identity, current and superseded,
because that digest is the directory name the manual revocation repair below
needs. `--json` adds `digest` and `revocationDirectory` to each entry of
`supersededIdentities`.

`migrate-identity` copies exactly one superseded operator key forward, verifies
that the copy loads as this repository's key, and writes a receipt under
`~/.agenticloop/operator-activation/migrations/`. Superseded key files and
revocation tombstones are **preserved, never deleted**, and rerunning the
command is a no-op.

A successful migration reports the state it **produced**, not the state it read:
`currentKeyState` becomes `present` and `currentKeyId` names the migrated key.
The replaced state is still reported, under `priorKeyState` and `priorKeyId`,
alongside `migratedFrom`. A rerun reports `already_migrated` with the same
current key.

Revocation tombstones need no migration at all: external deny evidence is always
read as the fail-closed union of the current and superseded registries, so a
revoked grant stays revoked whether or not a migration was ever run.

Any unreadable record, or any non-`.json` entry, in **any** of those registries
fails the whole read closed for that repository, which blocks activation until
it is resolved. `migrate-identity` deliberately does not touch revocations, so
the repair is to inspect
`~/.agenticloop/operator-activation/revocations/<identity-digest>/` directly.
`identity-status` reports each superseded identity's digest and tombstone count
so the affected directory can be located.

When more than one superseded key claims the same repository, both commands
report `conflict` and refuse. Choosing which operator identity survives is an
operator decision, so nothing is written; remove or rename the keys you do not
want to keep and rerun.

`activate` and `provision-key` refuse to mint a fresh identity while superseded
operator material exists, and name `migrate-identity` as the repair. Silently
provisioning there would look like ordinary first-time setup while orphaning the
operator's real key and every deny tombstone bound to it.

#### Activation refusals offer every scope you have

Every activation refusal renders from one shared plan, so the same facts never
produce different advice at different boundaries. It offers, in order:

1. the exact task — `npx agenticloop activate <task-id>`;
2. the current ready set as **one** confirmation, when there is more than one
   ready task — `npx agenticloop activate T-018 T-019 T-020`;
3. the canonical work unit, when a durable one is bound —
   `npx agenticloop activate --work-unit milestone:M2`.

A "batch" of one is not offered, and a synthesized `work-unit:<task-id>`
fallback is never offered as a work unit: it is identical in effect to the
exact-task command while implying broader coverage.

Surfacing the batch options reduces how often a human is interrupted. It never
reduces what a human has to see: every command is the interactive operator path,
there is no `--yes`, and a task-list or work-unit authorization covers exactly
the scope bound at confirmation — tasks added afterwards need a new one.

#### Expiry is not retroactive

Expiry means *this authority may not start new work*. It has never meant *the
work it already started never happened*.

- A grant that has expired cannot authorize a new dispatch.
- Closeout evaluates the grant as of the **consumption instant** when a packet
  was consumed for the task, so an execution that outlives its window does not
  retroactively lose the authority it had when it began. The reported
  `evaluatedAt` states which instant was used. Every activation check the
  closeout makes uses that same pinned instant — the covered-task assurance, the
  revalidation of the stored return, and the revalidation of the retained packet
  alike — so a consumed attempt cannot pass one of them and fail another.
- **Revocation is not expiry.** It is matched by grant identity and is
  time-independent, so a revoked grant still fails at the consumption instant.
- Pinning to a past instant can only narrow: a grant issued after an attempt
  started does not retroactively authorize it.

### Assurance grades

| Dimension | Grade | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Activation | `host_signed` | Parser/host-owned capture authenticated by an isolated signer. |
| Activation | `operator_confirmed` | Explicit local operator confirmation of exact task state. |
| Return | `host_receipt` | Authenticated host handoff receipt proving the producer role. |
| Return | `session_reported` | Schema-valid, revalidated role result with no authenticated producer proof. |

`standard` mode requires at least `operator_confirmed` activation and permits
`session_reported` returns. `hardened` mode requires `host_signed` and
`host_receipt`. Repository configuration (`agenticloop.json` `activation.mode`)
may raise the minimum but never lowers the external operator pin at
`~/.agenticloop/operator-activation/<target-sha256>.policy.json`.

`operator_confirmed` is procedural, local-user assurance. It is not equivalent
to an isolated host signer and does not resist arbitrary code running as the
same OS user. No command output describes it, or a `session_reported` return, as
cryptographically host-authenticated.

### `agenticloop host-trust`

```text
npx agenticloop host-trust status [--json]
npx agenticloop host-trust register <adapter-id> --key-id <id> --public-key <base64-or-path> \
    [--activation-capture supported] [--return-receipt supported] [--dry-run]
npx agenticloop host-trust rotate <adapter-id> --key-id <id> --public-key <base64-or-path> [--dry-run]
npx agenticloop host-trust revoke <adapter-id> [--dry-run]
```

Bounded provisioning for the external operator trust store that makes hardened
mode possible. Registration accepts only a **public** key; a private key is
refused rather than stored. There is deliberately no command that signs an
activation capture or a return receipt with the protected host key.

### Legacy host-signed captures

An adapter with a proven parser-owned capture producer may issue a verified
receipt to task creation:

```text
npx agenticloop task new "Title" --activation-input .agenticloop/tmp/activation-capture.json [--host-trust-store <expected-registered-path>]
```

The v2 receipt has a unique canonical capture ID, signed intended task ID,
canonical target repository, capture and expiry timestamps, closed adapter/key
identity, derived capability, and operator/normalized proof digests. The CLI
resolves the prospective task ID before validation and requires the signed ID
to match. Expired, future-dated, cross-task, cross-repository, tampered, and v1
supported captures fail before mutation. Caller-authored capability, integrity,
or payload JSON cannot authorize task creation. A verified task records both
`activation_input_digest` and `activation_capture_ref`.

A capture is freshness-bound, not single-use. The same exact capture may be
revalidated for its signed task and repository while its time window remains
current. It never authorizes another task, repository, or payload. Expiry does
not permit silent renewal or rebinding; a future supported host integration
must produce a fresh capture and activation-bound task.

The CLI derives the only permitted store path from the target's canonical real
path and the fixed per-user registry root
`~/.agenticloop/host-trust/`. The optional absolute `--host-trust-store` value
asserts that derived path; it cannot select an arbitrary external file. The
store is target-scoped registry metadata. A missing derived store safely yields
the shipped unsupported inventory; an existing malformed store remains an
error. A well-formed store that declares a `supported` capture or return
capability is typed negative/blocked unsupported-boundary evidence, not
malformed input: the public and delegated in-process CLI rejects every such
registry. Neither a boolean callback, environment
value, CLI option, nor same-user writable filesystem path can promote one. The
packaged protected-host seam requires a fresh nonce-bound Ed25519 challenge
response over authenticated host-controlled IPC, an inherited protected OS
handle, OS isolation, or an equivalent boundary outside the delegated process. A
repository-local
`.agenticloop/host-trust.json` is ordinary untrusted data and cannot authorize a
capture, packet, or return.

For ordinary non-activated Markdown scaffolding, use `task new <title>
--scaffold`. A scaffold task carries no activation authority and cannot be
dispatched in that state. It does not have to be recreated: run
`npx agenticloop activate <task-id>` and it becomes eligible for dispatch with
`operator_confirmed` assurance.

Dispatch resolves activation in one fixed order: a current valid legacy
host-signed task capture, then a current valid task activation binding, then
blocked. An existing activation-bound project therefore behaves exactly as
before, with no change to any task record.

New task contracts declare required checks with stable identities and explicit
kinds:

```text
- [RC-1] command: `npm test`
- [RC-2] manual: Inspect the generated adapter output.
```

The `## Required Checks` section is machine-parsed: it may contain only blank
lines and canonical bullets. Any other prose is rejected rather than ignored.
Command returns carry the same ID/kind/command, evidence, outcome, and an
integer exit code. Manual returns carry the same ID/kind/instruction, evidence,
and outcome with `exitCode: null`. Matching is order-insensitive by RC ID.

Prepare one exact Engineer handoff without task mutation:

```text
npx agenticloop task prepare-dispatch T-001 --host opencode --role engineer --output .agenticloop/tmp/dispatch.json --json
```

Produce the committed decomposition source first with `task
prepare-decomposition`. The command selects files or GitHub from
`.agenticloop/project.md`; GitHub may use `--repo <owner/name>` and follows the
complete issue pagination through the injected read-only transport. Both
backends emit the same shared scan semantics and an exact enumeration receipt.
Dispatch refetches that authoritative inventory before mutation.

Both preparation subcommands validate `task_backend` before they select an
enumerator or a transport. An unsupported value is refused with a single typed
`verification.context.malformed` diagnostic as the root cause; no inventory is
enumerated and no GitHub call is made. `--repo` names a GitHub repository, so
supplying it while `task_backend: files` is configured is a usage error rather
than a silently ignored flag.

The ordinary producer derives the Engineer assignment and safe existing durable
facts; it does not require hand-authored dispatch input. `--input` remains an
advanced compatibility route for projects where durable source selectors are
unavailable; it is validated normally and may not override refetched durable
authority. Input and output paths are relative to the selected target and must
remain inside it.

The committed decomposition source persists the exact dispatch revalidation
selectors. Its scan binds the base as an exact `git-tree:<oid>` identity and
each dependency snapshot twice: the semantic `source` identity the snapshot
declares about itself (for example `files:.agenticloop/tasks`) and the
target-relative `sourceRef` artifact path used to reopen that exact snapshot.
The selector is confined like every committed source: no absolute or
drive-qualified paths, no backslashes, no `.`/`..` segments, no symlink
traversal, and no resolution outside the repository. The committed scan is
schema version 2. A genuine schema-version-1 scan or decomposition cannot
supply the selector and fails with typed regeneration guidance; repair it by
re-running `task prepare-decomposition <id> --work-unit <id> --source-ref
<path> --source-revision <ref> --base <ref-or-tree> --dependencies <path>` with
the same inputs rather than editing the record. The command reruns readiness
from the exact Git tree and dependency snapshot, reads
decomposition from its committed `sourceRef`, and requires the source commit to
carry canonical `Task:` and `Agent: maintainer` attribution before emitting a versioned
`agenticloop.role-preparation` packet only when every binding is current. The
current packet is schema version 7 and binds the selected host, the exact closed
Engineer capability declaration and digest, and the canonical derived
degraded-enforcement report inventory plus a constant-size decomposition binding
to the committed scan source. The real shipped baseline was schema
version 2. Authentic versions 2 through 6 fail with typed
`dispatch.packet.stale`; regenerate them as version 7
instead of repairing them in place. Merely setting an old version number on
malformed input does not classify it as a legacy packet. A missing, malformed, non-canonical, or
implementation-denying declaration fails before dispatch.
An otherwise-current schema-v6 packet carrying the exact former version 3
degraded-report set is also classified as typed `dispatch.packet.stale` only
after its original digest and complete projected-current semantics validate;
regenerate it rather than accepting or rewriting it. A malformed v3 lookalike
remains malformed.
The files Engineer receives it through `task role-start T-001 --packet
<packet.json>`, which performs full validation before its atomic mutation. A
scaffold made with `task new --scaffold` has no verified activation
identity and cannot dispatch in that state; activate the existing task with
`npx agenticloop activate <task-id>` before dispatch.

Packet v7 names `taskContractDigest` separately from the immutable historical
`dispatchCarrierDigest`; it embeds the complete signed grant and binding and independently binds a
nullable return adapter (`--return-adapter <adapter-id>`). Packet digests are
integrity only. The in-process prepared-dispatch validation result is likewise
an unkeyed, exact-packet/result-bound integrity record: it detects alteration and
substitution but does not authenticate the validator or prove canonical origin.
Public files and GitHub mutation commands accept the prepared-dispatch packet,
not a validation-receipt option, and rerun the complete current
`canonicalDispatchValidator` immediately before mutation. A persisted receipt
or verdict crossing a process or trust boundary must be rederived from its
underlying packet or verified return. `task verify-return` persists observed schema-v4
`agenticloop.return-verification` evidence under `.agenticloop/returns/verifications/`;
every non-v4 record is a fail-closed typed incompatibility, including released
schema v2 and interim schema v3. Those records remain historical evidence but
cannot be relabelled, migrated, or consumed as current; safely resume with
freshly produced current evidence.
Closeout revalidates current records and never treats a
registered capability as proof an event happened. Standard plugin-free operation
uses `operator_confirmed` activation and freshly revalidated `session_reported`
returns. Optional protected host integration is required for `host_signed`
activation and `host_receipt` returns. Missing evidence fails both modes.
Return evidence is bound to the exact work unit as well as the task, contract,
and activation authority. When several successful observations exist for that
same tuple, the latest verified observation is current; older observations are
history and an equal-time conflict fails closed. GitHub verification and
closeout refetch the live PR identity. Git rederives the exact returned commit
range and requires its head to remain an ancestor of the current checkout, so
later contract-preserving workflow commits do not erase valid return evidence.

For a files-backed Engineer return, construct closed check evidence and derive
the raw return from current task/Git facts:

```text
npx agenticloop task role-start T-001 --packet .agenticloop/tmp/dispatch.json --json
npx agenticloop task check-evidence-update T-001 --packet .agenticloop/tmp/dispatch.json --check RC-1 --outcome passed --evidence "npm test passed" --json
npx agenticloop task prepare-return T-001 --packet .agenticloop/tmp/dispatch.json --check-evidence .agenticloop/tmp/T-001-checks.json --outcome implementation_ready_for_review --output .agenticloop/tmp/return.json --json
npx agenticloop task verify-return T-001 --packet .agenticloop/tmp/dispatch.json --return .agenticloop/tmp/return.json --from-current-repository --json
```

`role-start` creates the aggregate once at
`.agenticloop/tmp/T-001-checks.json`. That aggregate is mutable scratch and is
never committed. Each passing command check writes its immutable durable proof
to `.agenticloop/checks/T-001/RC-N.execution.json` by default; commit that proof
with canonical Engineer attribution. No mutating workflow command is legal
between the last check update and `prepare-return`. Repeating the exact public
`verify-return` reuses the first observation time and reports `already_current`;
changed semantic evidence remains a conflict.

`npx agenticloop task show <id> --json` is the read-only task-state command.
Usage refusals report `safeToRetry`, `mutationOccurred`, and canonical usage. A
role lease permits one retry only when the first two values are `true` and
`false`, respectively.

`prepare-return --outcome implementation_blocked` is cancellation-only.
Cancellation is evidence-bound and never inferred. No shipped public runtime
currently has a protected, non-agent-callable Agentic Loop cancellation receipt
producer, so `prepare-return` and `verify-return` refuse a positive
`cancellation_requested` claim. A structural
`agenticloop.cancellation-provenance` JSON record is not authority and cannot
be promoted by its digest or by host status:

```text
npx agenticloop task prepare-return T-001 --packet .agenticloop/tmp/dispatch.json --check-evidence .agenticloop/tmp/checks.json --outcome implementation_blocked --blocker-category cancellation_requested --cancellation-evidence .agenticloop/tmp/cancellation.json --output .agenticloop/tmp/return.json --json
npx agenticloop task verify-return T-001 --packet .agenticloop/tmp/dispatch.json --return .agenticloop/tmp/return.json --from-current-repository --cancellation-evidence .agenticloop/tmp/cancellation.json --json
```

Host idle/completed/terminated state, stop reasons, messages, timestamps, and
unkeyed digests are never consulted. Until a pinned protected receipt producer
exists, record the outcome as unknown/needs-context and obtain the required host
integration rather than claim cancellation. The future receipt must bind the
exact logical invocation, request, packet, task, controller, observed result,
strict UTC request/observation times, freshness, and replay policy.

Ordinary workflow or tooling blockers are not cancellation and produce no raw
role return. Report a non-authoritative `agenticloop.session-status` version 1
with `authoritative: false`, exact task/attempt/packet/contract/carrier-terminal
bindings, blocker category, diagnostic code, resumption condition,
`rawReturn: null`, and `transitionAuthority: false`. This host/session status is
observation only: it never satisfies successful return, review, acceptance,
closeout, or authenticated cancellation.

A verified return authorizes reuse for a fixed window. The version 1
return-use freshness policy is exactly 86,400 seconds (24 hours). Omitting the
`return_use_freshness` project configuration selects that stable default; a
declared policy must match the closed version-1 shape and value exactly, and
missing, malformed, old, future, or extended policies fail closed.
The 86,400-second value is the only supported value for policy version 1. A
future tunable policy requires a new policy version or a separately authorized
contract change.

All public artifact paths are relative to the selected target, must remain
inside it, and must name regular files rather than links. For a `passed`
command check the CLI itself parses the exact required command as inert argv
(no shell), runs it at the target root with a five-minute timeout, and writes
target-confined schema-v4
`agenticloop.execution-evidence` JSON with the actual argv, child exit code,
and output. A caller-supplied execution artifact or `--outcome passed
--exit-code 0` cannot prove execution.

Without `--execution-output` the artifact is written to
`.agenticloop/checks/<task-id>/<check-id>.execution.json`, which is a tracked
path. That is deliberate: proof that a required check ran belongs to the
repository, not to the machine that ran it, and an artifact written into
gitignored scratch is invisible on every other checkout - so a reviewer is
pointed at a file that does not exist for them, and a later attempt rebuilds
identical proof it cannot see. Commit that evidence with the rest of the
workflow state after the return is produced; committing it beforehand moves the
repository state the execution evidence is bound to. Manual, failed, blocked, and not-run
observations retain their existing bounded observation form.

On Windows, the runner resolves `.cmd` and `.bat` shims on `PATH` (preferring
them over an extensionless shim such as `npm`) and invokes the resolved shim
through `cmd.exe /d /s /c` with reviewed argument quoting. This wrapper support
does not permit shell syntax in a required-check command; the required command
is still parsed as inert argv and shell metacharacters are rejected.
At role start, the current dispatch is revalidated through the live canonical
dispatch boundary before its single-use consumption. `prepare-return` is
Engineer-owned and read-only: it authenticates that packet and requires the
matching already-consumed invocation and current carrier lineage. Host admission,
task status, and free-form messages cannot substitute for its derived return. The ordinary
files verifier uses `--from-current-repository` to rederive evidence
independently from current Git and task facts; `--repository-evidence <path>` remains advanced compatibility,
and the two options are mutually exclusive. `--from-current-repository` is
files-only: on the GitHub backend it is refused with a typed usage error
before any refetch, because caller-independent rederivation requires the local
trusted checkout.

A passed command check in a files-backed return is proved by the closed
schema-v4 `agenticloop.execution-evidence` artifact, never by exit-code prose.
Schema-v2 and schema-v3 execution evidence and their digest domains are typed
incompatible and must be regenerated rather than relabeled or re-digested.
Current packets bind required-check evidence contract v2 into their semantic
digest: every command check carries `executionEvidence`; a passed check carries
its `{ path, digest }` artifact reference and every non-passed check carries
`null`. Both the return producer and `verify-return` revalidate the artifact
against the exact packet, invocation, task, carrier, repository, and product
identities it binds. Removing this property is malformed, not legacy
compatibility. Packets authenticated as schema 7 or older are typed stale and
must be regenerated; they cannot authorize a current return or protected
transition.

Required-check retry history remains an explicit contract decision. The current
v2 check-evidence contract stores one current observation per `RC-N`; it defines
neither a `retryPolicy` field nor append-only per-check `history`, and the CLI
must not claim that overwriting an observation preserves retry history. Before
adding those fields, the product contract must decide all of the following
together: where the retry budget is authored (task inventory or project
policy), which outcomes consume it, whether the initial `not_run` observation
counts, the append-only history carrier and digest domain, and how a retry binds
to execution-evidence schema v4 under concurrent writers. That decision requires
a new required-check evidence contract version and packet migration rule; it
must not be introduced as optional fields in v2.

`closeout prepare --legacy-unactivated --legacy-reason <text>` is the interactive,
standard-only, exact-work-unit compatibility exception. New waivers name only
missing activation evidence. An authentic, unexpired schema-v1 waiver that also
contains the retired `return_evidence_absent` scope is verified against its
original signed fields, then projected to activation-only behavior with
`compatibility.waiver_scope_retired`; dispatch consumption and canonical
verified-return evidence remain mandatory. Both JSON and human-readable
closeout preparation expose that diagnostic, while the assurance report retains
the unchanged signed source record as `compatibility_waiver`. It never hides revoked,
stale, malformed, conflicting, mismatched, or cryptographically invalid evidence,
and hardened mode rejects it.

`task verify-return` authenticates the raw return, independently derives or
checks repository evidence, and persists the closed
`agenticloop.return-verification` schema-v4 record. Every non-v4 verification
record is fail-closed typed incompatible lifecycle evidence, including released
schema v2 and interim schema v3. It remains historical evidence but cannot be
edited, relabelled, migrated, or consumed as current; safely resume with a fresh
current packet, check evidence, raw return, and verification.
Standard mode permits an explicitly `session_reported`, freshly revalidated
return at reduced/unverified assurance. For `host_receipt` assurance, the
packet-bound producer receipt and protected host-issued execution receipt are
required as applicable:

```text
npx agenticloop task verify-return T-001 --packet packet.json --return role-return.json [--from-current-repository | --repository-evidence repository-evidence.json] [--producer-receipt producer-receipt.json --execution-receipt execution-receipt.json] [--cancellation-evidence cancellation.json] [--repo <owner/name>] [--resume-owner <role-id> --redelegation-authority redelegation.json | --recovery-request recovery.json --human-disposition disposition.json --human-disposition-authority <authority-id> --human-disposition-key-id <key-id>] [--host-trust-store <expected-registered-path>] --json
```

For a files-backed Engineer run, retain the role-start carrier and record only
bounded evidence mutations before constructing the raw return:

```text
npx agenticloop task evidence T-001 --class implementation_artifact_evidence --expect-digest <currentCarrierDigest> --product-head <productHead> --json
npx agenticloop task evidence T-001 --class implementation_summary_evidence --expect-digest <currentCarrierDigest> --summary <text> --check-evidence <text> --json
npx agenticloop task evidence T-001 --class implementation_outcome_evidence --expect-digest <currentCarrierDigest> --outcome implementation_ready_for_review --json
npx agenticloop task evidence T-001 --class structured_task_evidence --expect-digest <currentCarrierDigest> --input .agenticloop/tmp/task-evidence.json --json
npx agenticloop task review-prepare T-001 --json
```

`task evidence` atomically writes the task carrier and a versioned receipt under
`.agenticloop/handoffs/task-mutations/`. It refuses an unreceipted carrier,
contract drift, unknown fields, or cross-role ownership.
The structured schema canonically updates `## Scope Completed`, `## Evidence`,
`## Deviations`, `## Known Gaps`, `## Verification Attempts`, `## Maintainer
Triage`, `## Retry Authorization`, and `## Revision Resolution` without
duplicate headings; identical application is a no-op. The chain binds
the dispatched workflow role, invocation ID, `taskContractDigest`, attempt ID,
`dispatchCarrierDigest`, and the resulting `currentCarrierDigest`; a caller's
`actorRole` field is never provenance by itself. Engineer owns Revision
Resolution as well as Scope Completed, Evidence, Deviations, Known Gaps, and
Verification Attempts. Maintainer owns Maintainer Triage and Retry
Authorization. Verification Attempts use stable `RC-N` headings and canonical
attempt nesting; Revision Resolution uses the canonical `- [F-N] ... [ref:
...]` grammar. The writer validates with the same semantic parsers before and
after persistence and changes only its marked section blocks. Raw returns and repository evidence name
`productBaseHead`, `productHead`, `workflowHead`, `candidateHead`, separate
product/workflow paths, and exact chain references. `task review-prepare` uses
one command-local carrier snapshot and writes no review receipt when it changes.

`task review-prepare --json` also emits two revision-routing fields,
`findingResolutionMatrix` and `matrixDecision`. Both are `null` on a first
review: the matrix is scaffolded only on a revision round, once the review record
carries a `needs_revision` outcome (an `AGENT_REVIEW_FINDINGS` result). When
populated, `matrixDecision.maintainerFixupEligible` is `true` only when every
finding in the round is `record-only`; that routes a record-only correction to
the Maintainer without consuming an Engineer revision round, while any
implementation-changing finding routes to the Engineer. Classification is
currently derived per revision round, not per finding: the round's single
classification is mapped onto every finding id and the disposition is uniform
across the round. The `contract-changing` class exists in the schema but is
currently unreachable — the review record permits only `implementation_changing`
and `record_only`, and a protected-contract change is blocked separately by the
`protectedContractUnchanged` check, never routed through the matrix. Per-finding
classification is a known limitation, not yet implemented.

The CLI never receives signing material. The operator registry contains only
Ed25519 public keys and scopes them to one canonical target checkout. A host or
OS policy must keep that fixed registry non-writable by agents; the CLI rejects
caller-selected alternative stores. The producer-receipt and execution-receipt
selectors are target-relative and confined. The producer receipt binds its target
repository, adapter/key identity, invocation ID, packet, return, host-observed
producer role, liveness, and canonical repository evidence digest.
Receipt-controlled semantic fields are evaluated only after the pinned key
verifies the signature over canonical bytes. A forged `producerRole` therefore
yields generic authentication failure; an authentically signed wrong producer
yields `role_return.producer_mismatch`. After authentication, the observed
producer must match both packet assignment and return claim; cooperative
`Task:`/`Agent:` trailers cannot repair a mismatch. The protected host-issued
execution receipt is verified through the external protected host boundary, not
by CLI-held signing material or self-attestation. Its replay binding is prepared
and committed by the protected replay authority, then revalidated as current on
later verification; a missing, replayed, stale, or invalid required receipt
blocks rather than trusting Orchestrator assertions. The CLI supplies no fallback
replay ledger: a real protected host integration must retain durable replay state
across process restarts. In-memory replay authorities are test fixtures only.
The files verifier also
reconstructs the current branch, head, changed paths, durable commit range, and
canonical attribution from Git and rejects dirty tracked or untracked in-scope
state. The GitHub verifier additionally refetches the live PR number, state, URL,
branch, and head; a closed or changed PR is stale. The shipped receipt baseline,
schema version 1, receives typed `role_return.receipt_stale` reissue guidance
only when its complete canonical bytes authenticate. A successful result uses
`disposition: proceed` plus a separate non-completion implementation outcome; it
is never review-entry evidence or completion.

For a cancellation-blocked return, omitting `--resume-owner` retains the authenticated
producer role. A different owner requires `--redelegation-authority`; the
version 2 record must be signed by the exact pinned Orchestrator/human authority
and bind the current return, packet, producer, target owner, issuer, issue and
expiry times, and invalidators. Destructive, scope-changing, and host-state
recovery instead uses `--recovery-request` plus a version 2
`--human-disposition` signed by the pinned human authority, with the authority
and key selected explicitly by `--human-disposition-authority` and
`--human-disposition-key-id`. The import edge
validates these records before persistence, repair, transition, or host-state
change and preserves human attribution. Labels, trailers, producer strings,
record digests, or public keys carried by a record cannot grant authority.

The ordinary CLI still refuses a trust store with supported dynamic adapters.
A supported host integration reaches verification only through the protected
in-process host-authority seam, which approves the exact target, derived trust
path, and supported adapter IDs after authenticating its own host-controlled
capture/receipt boundary. No public flag enables that seam. Use
`scripts/sign-blocked-authority.mjs` to create signed redelegation or human
disposition records with the canonical serializers; the request shapes and
safe key-handling procedure are documented in
[Host Adapters](./host-adapters.md#constructing-signed-blocked-authority-records).

The packet also carries the canonical version 4 degraded-enforcement report set.
`prepare-dispatch` emits `capability.enforcement.degraded` warnings through the
repair policy, and `verify-return` performs the canonical
packet/report/declaration check at the receive edge. A duplicate
post-validation report branch is not counted as another enforcement layer.
Malformed, contradictory, or declaration-drifted reports fail closed. The
report pins the declaration that supplies the deterministic recovery route. This is an
Agentic Loop evidence boundary, not a claim that arbitrary external writes are
prevented.

See [Host Adapters](./host-adapters.md#operator-trust-stores) for the external
store format, key rotation, and failure behavior. Every shipped adapter remains
unsupported for activation capture and cannot be upgraded by this option.

## Task-body editing and attribution

For a GitHub task record, use the closed loop below instead of editing an issue
body inline:

```text
npx agenticloop task-body fetch --issue <n> --output .agenticloop/tmp/issue-<n>.md
npx agenticloop task-body lint --issue <n> --body-file .agenticloop/tmp/issue-<n>.md
npx agenticloop task-body apply --issue <n> --body-file .agenticloop/tmp/issue-<n>.md --expect-digest <digest> --dry-run
npx agenticloop task-body apply --issue <n> --body-file .agenticloop/tmp/issue-<n>.md --expect-digest <digest> --yes
```

Routine edits avoid a whole-body rewrite:

```text
npx agenticloop task-body set-field --issue <n> --field review_budget --value 3 --expect-digest <digest> --dry-run
npx agenticloop task-body transition --issue <n> --status agent-ready --expect-digest <digest> --base <base-ref> --dependencies <dependency-snapshot.json> --dry-run
npx agenticloop task-body establish-baseline --issue <n> --expect-digest <digest> --authority <ref> --actor <login> --dry-run
npx agenticloop task-body authorize-correction --issue <n> --body-file <candidate.md> --expect-digest <digest> --reason <text> --authority <ref> --actor <login> --dry-run
```

During a recognized Engineer run, use the bounded evidence command rather than a
generic task-body edit:

```text
npx agenticloop task-body evidence --issue <n> --class implementation_artifact_evidence --expect-digest <digest> --product-head <productHead> --dry-run
npx agenticloop task-body evidence --issue <n> --class implementation_summary_evidence --expect-digest <digest> --summary <text> --check-evidence <text> --dry-run
npx agenticloop task-body evidence --issue <n> --class implementation_outcome_evidence --expect-digest <digest> --outcome implementation_ready_for_review --dry-run
```

It consumes the current local GitHub dispatch-consumption generation and writes
the resulting carrier-mutation receipt after refetching the exact issue body.
Only artifact, summary/check, and non-authoritative outcome evidence are
permitted; a protected contract change or an unreceipted carrier change is
refused. Repeat a valid dry run with `--yes`.

Repeat any dry run with `--yes` only after inspecting its patch plan. The first
two commands make one bounded body change through the same lint/refetch/expected
digest transaction. Agent-ready additionally binds the explicit base and
dependency snapshot into its receipt; neither can be defaulted. The latter two
create and refetch a separate verified task-contract record carrier; body
markers are only caches. An `agent-ready` transition fails closed without a base
tree inventory.

The transition gates belong to the write, not to the `transition` subcommand.
Whenever a candidate's `status` differs from the fetched remote status — through
`transition`, through `set-field --field status`, or through an `apply` whose
body-file carries a different status — the same contract applies: the change must
be a legal transition, `agent-ready` requires the explicit base and dependency
snapshot, and `closed` must pass the terminal-scope decision. There is no
subcommand that reaches a protected status change unguarded. `set-field` and
`apply` therefore accept `--dependencies` whenever their candidate becomes
`agent-ready`. They also accept `--note` for a real status change. A note is
rejected for a non-status update rather than silently discarded, except that an
already-current `in-progress` request is explicitly a new role start rather than
a note-only update and requires a fresh dispatch packet.

A transition may also reconcile the projections it owns. `--note <text>` is
persisted as an identified issue comment rather than accepted and discarded, and repeated
`--label <name>` values are reconciled after a verified body write: every
requested label is added, superseded labels inside the owned `status:` namespace
are removed, and every unrelated label is left untouched. GitHub provides no
cross-resource transaction, so a body success with a failed label or comment
step returns an exact partial receipt whose per-projection `owned`, `attempted`,
and `complete` facts let a rerun resume only the remaining projections without
rewriting the body. The comment identity is a deterministic marker over the
repository/issue, predecessor and candidate digests, and normalized note. The
comment is complete only after an exact-body refetch from the authenticated
publisher and a trusted actor/association. A copied marker, foreign author, or
altered note body is not proof. An ambiguous post that landed is therefore
recovered without a duplicate, while an untrusted pre-seeded marker cannot
suppress publication. A genuine body no-op never invents a historical
transition comment.

Resume is provenance-typed. When the remote body already equals the candidate,
the result distinguishes a genuinely current no-op (expected, candidate, and
current all agree), a receipt-proven prior write, an ambiguous transport response
recovered from that same operation evidence, and an unattributed matching
external write. The last is never reported as proven publication: it returns a
non-authoritative result requiring refetch and reconciliation.

An ambiguous transport response whose refetch proves the candidate was not
applied returns an `uncommitted` mutation receipt with no changed paths and an
explicit recovery instruction. The attempted write is therefore represented by
the same receipt contract as successful, partial, and resumed outcomes.

A receipt-proven prior write requires a retained recovery artifact whose recorded
outcome is `applied` — written after a refetch observed the candidate bytes on
the carrier, and bound to that artifact's own operation id. The artifact files
alone are not enough: they are written before the transport call, so an operation
whose refetch confirmed the write did not apply leaves them behind too. Such an
artifact stays `not_applied` and never attributes a later matching body to this
toolkit. An operation that ends before its refetch stays `attempted` and proves
nothing either, and an outcome marker that is malformed or names a different
operation reads as no proof at all. Outcome markers use schema version 1 and
the closed field set `kind`, `schemaVersion`, `operationId`, `outcome`, and
`observedAt`; a missing, extra, mistyped, or invalid field is malformed.

`fetch` preserves a live leading BOM exactly and writes a separately labelled
sanitized candidate. `apply` refuses the BOM-bearing candidate, stale remote
bodies, and post-write digest/contract mismatches. It reports a unified diff and
structured change summary. Recovery paths are unique; verified success retains
them by default and failure retains them for evidence. Do not delete recovery
artifacts until their reported policy permits it.

`task-body lint` fetches the live issue body and comments by default so it can
validate lifecycle transitions and trusted carriers. `--offline` explicitly
reports unavailable live provenance; optional `--trusted-records <snapshot>`
must contain validated carrier data and never claims live verification. The
offline JSON envelope reports `contextMode: "offline"`, `lintValid`,
`graphConsistent`, `provenanceVerified: false`, and `publicationReady: false`;
the exit status reflects lint validity only, and offline lint never satisfies
an authority-dependent readiness or publication gate.

GitHub task-contract trust is configured in `.agenticloop/project.md` with
`trusted_task_contract_actors` (see `agenticloop/backends/github.md`). The
deprecated `github_trusted_actors` alias is honored with a warning.

Files-backed current tasks use `task_contract_schema: 2`. Run
`task establish-baseline <id> --actor <git-author> --authority <kind:reference>`
and commit the task history artifact separately before moving to `agent-ready`.
A material contract change after the baseline uses
`task authorize-correction <id> --expect-prior-digest <digest> --reason <text>
--authority <kind:reference> --actor <git-author>`, also committed separately.
Files history is verified append-only against first-parent Git history with
per-record commit provenance (see `agenticloop/backends/files.md`).

Every supported task mutation returns a versioned
`agenticloop.task-mutation-receipt` that binds the task identity, the expected
predecessor digest, the candidate and resulting digests, the exact evidence
context and its derived digest, the verification-result identity, owned
projections with their attempted and verified-complete state, changed paths, the
mutation disposition, rollback facts when compensation was proven, and one copyable
read-only revalidation command. A command is receipt-safe only when its exact
canonical registry leaf is explicitly marked for revalidation; all unmarked,
dynamic, unknown, or option-dependent forms fail closed. `init` and `setup`
qualify only with `--dry-run`. A `rolled_back` receipt additionally requires
closed rollback evidence whose predecessor and resulting digests exactly match
the receipt, with zero changed paths. Obtain a files task's current digest from
`task lint <id> --json`, then pass it to status:

```text
npx agenticloop task status T-001 in-progress --expect-digest sha256:<digest>
```

`--expect-digest` is required for every task-status transition, including
records with no `task_contract_schema`. An `agent-ready` transition additionally
requires exactly one of `--base <ref>` or `--base-paths <inventory.json>`, plus
`--dependencies <snapshot.json>`. Supplying both base forms is refused.

An `in-progress` transition is the role start, and it accepts
`--dispatch-packet <packet.json>` naming a canonical `task prepare-dispatch`
result. With a packet that binds the current task, contract generation, carrier
digest, and Engineer role, the start is recognized and the JSON payload carries
the closed `agenticloop.handoff-recognition` verdict and records a durable
single-use dispatch consumption. Without a packet, with a consumed packet, or
with a packet that does not bind, the transition is refused, typed `handoff.*`
diagnostics are reported, and the task record is left unchanged. The complete
current-state `task prepare-dispatch --packet` verifier is rerun immediately
before mutation, including task, readiness, repository, decomposition,
inventory, activation, and current operator policy; a recomputed digest or a
packet made stale by a later repository-head change does not pass.

The requested target status defines the role-start boundary. Requesting
`in-progress` when the carrier already says `in-progress` still requires fresh
recognition and consumes the packet exactly once before returning a validated
no-op. Adding `--note` makes the note part of that new start; there is no
note-only route that can claim a role start. The 24-hour verified-return
transition-use ceiling is immutable v1 policy, not operator configurable.

`agenticloop task-body transition --issue <n> --status in-progress` is the same
boundary on the GitHub carrier and accepts the same `--dispatch-packet` option
with the same fail-closed outcomes. A refusal happens before any issue edit. The CLI
never selects `HEAD`, a default branch, or a dependency disposition on the
author's behalf, and it resolves `--base <ref>` to that ref's exact Git tree
object id so a later branch move cannot redefine the recorded baseline.

The dependency snapshot is a validated document, not a bare status map:

```json
{
  "kind": "agenticloop.dependency-snapshot",
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "source": "files:.agenticloop/tasks",
  "observedAt": "2026-07-29T10:00:00.000Z",
  "freshnessPolicy": { "maxAgeSeconds": 86400 },
  "statuses": { "T-002": "accepted" }
}
```

An explicit empty `"statuses": {}` is a positive declaration that the task has
no dependencies and evaluates as satisfied. It is not equivalent to omitting
the dependency snapshot: every guarded `agent-ready` mutation still requires
the versioned snapshot, source identity, observation time, and freshness policy.

Missing, malformed, stale, and changed evidence stay distinct: a snapshot older
than its own freshness policy is `stale`, an unparseable one is `malformed`, an
absent one is `missing`, and a superseded `--expect-digest` is `changed`.

Receipt revalidation is read-only and executable verbatim from the target
directory. A readiness transition emits a `task-readiness` command carrying the
resulting digest and the exact base and dependency inputs; a non-readiness
transition emits the lint verifier bound to the resulting digest:

Arguments that need quoting are emitted only when one double-quoted spelling is
both inert and byte-exact in POSIX shells, PowerShell, and `cmd.exe`. Values with
quotes, backticks, dollar/percent/exclamation expansion, a trailing backslash,
doubled backslashes, CR, LF, or a backslash-newline pair are refused rather than emitted.
An otherwise-safe value containing one interior backslash is double quoted
because an unquoted POSIX shell would consume the backslash as an escape.

```text
npx agenticloop task-readiness --task-body <carrier> --mode authoring --expect-task-digest sha256:<digest> --base <tree-oid> --dependencies <snapshot.json>
npx agenticloop task lint T-001 --expect-task-digest sha256:<digest>
npx agenticloop task-body lint --issue <n> --expect-task-digest sha256:<digest>
```

The rendered command is presentation only; receipt validation parses its
restricted inert argv, unwraps supported `agenticloop`, `.cmd`, local-bin,
`node bin/agenticloop.js`, `npx`, and `pnpm exec` launchers, and rejects a
recognized mutation regardless of launcher spelling.

`task-readiness --expect-task-digest` also re-evaluates the trusted
task-contract chain, so revalidating an already-`agent-ready` task is never
confirmed on scope and dependency facts alone. A later verifier run without the
exact base and dependency inputs reports missing context; it must not treat the
committed record as invalid or compensate by rolling it back.

The read-only command emits `agenticloop.task-readiness-evidence`, a separately
validated summary that may record `dependencies: null`. It does not claim the
mutation-only `agenticloop.task-evidence-context` kind because a read-only
evaluation has no authoritative predecessor-to-successor transition. Guarded
mutations continue to carry the complete mutation evidence context in their
receipts.

Generic `accepted -> closed` is allowed only when the canonical terminal-scope
resolver proves `none`. Configured group scope, explicit durable task-set scope,
and indeterminate scope refuse generic closure. Explicit scope is derived from
any of three durable carriers: a typed human-selection receipt under
`.agenticloop/scope/*.json`, a current validated audit record, or a provenanced
closeout marker on the task carrier. Carrier freshness is deliberately distinct:
human selection uses `observedAt` and its `maxAgeSeconds`; a closeout marker uses
the supersession-resolved current marker plus the current carrier digest; an audit
record uses its exact current validated durable record and its bound
artifact/candidate and covered-task facts. Audit records do not claim a separate
wall-clock expiry. Conflicting, stale, malformed, or incomplete evidence is
`indeterminate` and blocks every terminal action until it is repaired and
re-derived.

Audit-due diagnostics preserve the same uncertainty. If the task inventory is
unreadable or invalid, `doctor` reports an indeterminate audit scope with the
inventory reason; it never turns that failure into an empty "nothing due" list.

A typed human-selection receipt looks like:

```json
{
  "kind": "agenticloop.human-scope-selection",
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "workUnit": "selection:owner-1",
  "tasks": ["T-001", "T-002"],
  "authority": "human: repository owner",
  "reason": "Owner selected this terminal scope.",
  "observedAt": "2026-07-29T10:00:00.000Z",
  "freshnessPolicy": { "maxAgeSeconds": 86400 }
}
```

The terminal transition for an established scope is closeout-owned. After
`closeout record` publishes a completion-eligible marker, it transitions the
exact covered task set from `accepted` to `closed`: the files backend uses one
guarded filesystem transaction, and GitHub uses guarded per-carrier transitions
that report partial external progress rather than claiming cross-resource
atomicity. A safe rerun resumes from already verified terminal steps.

Publishing the marker is not the whole operation. A rerun that finds this exact
packet's marker already current resumes at the terminal transition instead of
reporting success, so a first run that published and then failed partway through
the covered transitions can be finished.

The rerun compares the canonical closeout provenance projection — the same
projection the packet digest is computed over, so it cannot omit a fact the
digest depends on. Marker publication changes nothing in it: carrier revisions
are computed with marker blocks normalized out, so a substantive carrier edit
after publication still fails closed as a stale packet. Only `predecessor_marker`
is exempted, and only when the live value is this packet's own digest — the
marker the operation provably published.

`init`, `setup`, and `update` emit and persist a prior-gate
`agenticloop.lifecycle-mutation-receipt` to
`.agenticloop/lifecycle-receipt.json`. It separates two facts a prior gate must
never conflate: `transactionDisposition` reports whether the filesystem
transaction completed, and `commitDisposition` reports whether those exact paths
are durably committed. A path written to disk but untracked is reported as
untracked, never as committed. `unresolved: true` whenever required setup state
remains uncommitted, untracked, partially applied, stale, or unverifiable, and
`task-readiness` refuses to build a readiness claim on an unresolved prior gate.
Both files and GitHub mutations also refuse to grant `agent-ready` under the
same condition; the check belongs to the authoritative handoff write, not only
to its read-only diagnostic.

The receipt is unauthenticated JSON in the working tree, so it is verified rather
than recognized on every read. Its schema version and every consumed field are
checked, and `unresolved` must follow from the two dispositions recorded beside
it. Each recorded path is then re-fingerprinted, and the commit disposition the
consumer reads is re-derived from current per-path Git state rather than read
back from the document.

Re-deriving is what makes the gate correct in both directions. Committing the
listed paths resolves it, exactly as the receipt's own next action offers. A path
that leaves the index — `git rm --cached` changes no bytes at all — un-resolves
it. Content that no longer matches what the transaction applied is reported as
drift and blocks the handoff. Editing the receipt to say `unresolved: false`
resolves nothing; changing the state it describes does.

Attribution rewrite records are read-only CLI surfaces:

```text
npx agenticloop commit-attribution repair-record-render --record repair.json --output record.json
npx agenticloop commit-attribution repair-record-lint --record record.json
```

They render and validate provenance only; they never amend, push, force-push,
or publish a record.

Before committing GitHub-backed work, use a message file and one contiguous
final trailer block:

```text
npx agenticloop commit-attribution check --task T-001 --message-file .agenticloop/tmp/T-001-commit-message.txt
git commit -F .agenticloop/tmp/T-001-commit-message.txt
npx agenticloop commit-attribution check --task T-001
npx agenticloop commit-attribution check --task T-001 --role maintainer --commit HEAD
```

Push only after both checks pass. Separate `git commit -m` paragraphs for
`Task:` and `Agent:` fail prospective validation.
Role-aware attribution is cooperative evidence, not producer authentication;
Git author identity, workflow role, operator authority, and verifier identity
remain separate.

## Workflow budgets

`task new` materializes `attempt_budget` from target
`default_attempt_budget`, then built-in `5`. A task-specific override is an
authorized carrier-only `attempt_budget` edit while no attempt is live; it is
outside the protected task contract and does not use `task
authorize-correction`. `task new` has no budget override option. The field is
the hard limit for equivalent no-progress
attempts. The command also materializes `review_budget` from the target
project's `default_review_budget`, then the built-in `5`; this is a Review Round
Checkpoint threshold, not a review cap. `audit new --budget <n>` is an explicit override;
without it, the command materializes `default_audit_budget`, then the built-in
`3`. Existing task and audit records keep their stored values.

## Audit report and closeout

The Auditor emits exactly one `auditor_report_v1` JSON object described in
`agenticloop/agents/auditor.md`. Persist it without rewriting its findings:

```text
npx agenticloop audit report AUD-001 --file .agenticloop/tmp/AUD-001-run-1.json
Get-Content -Raw '.agenticloop/tmp/AUD-001-run-1.json' |
  npx agenticloop audit report AUD-001 --stdin
```

`--file`, `--stdin`, and legacy inline fields are mutually exclusive. The wire
format requires the closed producer `{ "roleId": "auditor" }`, all six
perspectives, and every finding field (`id`, `severity`,
`blocking`, `claim`, `evidenceRefs`, `consequence`, `requiredOutcome`, and
`verificationRequired`). Unknown fields fail rather than being dropped. A host
receipt is `verified` only when an available host verifier validates the exact
canonical digest of the complete normalized report, including producer,
invocation, artifact, covered tasks, verdict, findings, perspectives, evidence,
and assessment. In `standard` mode a distinct invocation may omit the receipt;
the accepted run is graded `session_reported` and records
`Producer authenticated: false`. In `hardened` mode that return is below policy
and is returned to Auditor without consuming budget; a verified protected-host
receipt is required and produces `host_receipt` with
`Producer authenticated: true`. Same-session audit remains invalid in both
modes. Legacy inline reports remain explicitly `legacy_inline_v1`; they do not
establish a fresh wire-format Auditor return. Visible and embedded report
provenance must agree.

Audit schema version 3 persists the observed Auditor-return grade and producer
authentication state on every run. Audit gate output, closeout packet schema
version 2, and closeout marker schema version 3 carry those values and enforce
the effective minimum again at closeout. Marker v3 also persists
`AGENT_CLOSEOUT_TASKS`, so diagnostic status can reconstruct the independently
recorded task boundary without borrowing it from the audit certificate.
Canonicalizing a version 2 wire-format
run derives the grade conservatively from its existing provenance and receipt;
older or inline history does not gain fresh-return authority through migration.

Each accepted audit report records a budget-consumption cause. Use
`--cause substantive_audit` (the default), `human_authorized_retry`, or
`other_plan_required`. `human_authorized_retry` additionally requires
`--consumption-authority "human:<identity>"` and `--consumption-reason <text>`;
`other_plan_required` requires a bounded `--consumption-plan <reference>` of at
most 200 characters. Declared product-invalidation recovery remains unavailable
and is refused before any budget is consumed; it requires the existing human
budget override. A rejected or malformed report never consumes budget.

`audit status` lists the cause of every consumed run in both human and `--json`
output, so an exhausted budget always carries provenance.

An audit history written before `Consumption cause` became required stays
parseable and has exactly one explicit, non-destructive migration route:

```text
npx agenticloop audit baseline <audit-id> --migrate-consumption-cause
```

It records `unrecorded_legacy` for each affected run, preserving every other
byte. That cause states honestly that the cause was never captured; it never
asserts a substantive audit and never invents human authority. The migration is
idempotent, fails closed on unrecognized live content, and cannot be combined
with `--canonicalize`, `--artifact`, `--covered-tasks`, or `--evidence`.

Audit baseline/report rewrites preserve recognized structure canonically and
fail before mutation when an unrecognized live section cannot be proven
lossless. JSON mutation results carry an exact before/after receipt and
post-write revalidation route.

Closeout is two-stage and packets are restricted to `.agenticloop/tmp/`:

```text
npx agenticloop closeout prepare --work-unit milestone:M00 \
  --artifact commit:<full-sha> --output .agenticloop/tmp/milestone-M00-closeout.json
npx agenticloop closeout record --packet .agenticloop/tmp/milestone-M00-closeout.json --dry-run
npx agenticloop closeout record --packet .agenticloop/tmp/milestone-M00-closeout.json --yes
```

`--artifact` is mandatory for preparation and must be exactly
`commit:<full-git-sha>` naming an existing commit in the target repository. It
never defaults to the audit's certified candidate. Preparation independently
compares the candidate's product tree with the task/audit evidence, including
when work-unit audit is disabled.

`prepare` exit 0 means `completion_eligible: true`; exit 1 emits a truthful
non-complete or unevaluable packet. `status` exits 0 only for one current,
reconstructable `complete` marker. `record` exits 0 for a current applied or
idempotent marker, including a truthful non-complete correction and a
same-packet retry whose exact digest is already the one current marker.
Packets expose `publishable`, `completion_eligible`, `recommended_status`,
and structured reasons. Marker states are `complete`, `follow_up_required`,
`needs_context`, and `blocked`; corrections supersede exact prior references
without deleting history.

Plan synchronization is mechanical. When a selected source plan
(`documents.plan`) applies, an omitted `--plan-sync` never completes:
`--plan-sync not_required` is the explicit visible opt-out, and
`--plan-sync synced [--plan-ref <path>] [--plan-revision sha256:<hash>]`
verifies that the plan exists, that its task table covers the work items past
`planned`/`in-progress`, and binds the exact plan content revision into the
packet digest. Unrelated Markdown tables may precede the task table, but the
selected plan must resolve inside the target repository. A plan edit after
certification stales the packet and marker.

`--improvement-ref <id>` must name an existing, valid improvement proposal
(`improvement lint` clean) that relates to the work unit. Improvement
`--source-ref` values must resolve against live durable state: audit IDs and
runs, task IDs, decision IDs, closeout marker digests, or proposal IDs;
fabricated references fail before any file is created.

After certification only specifically validated workflow deltas survive: the
bound audit record, the exact marker mutation, a covered-task
`accepted -> closed` terminal transition, an append-only schema-valid
`task.closed` event whose task ID and `files` backend match the applicable
event-log path and whose event ID is unique, an exact valid referenced
proposal whose source references resolve against the same command-local live
state, and transient `.agenticloop/tmp/` activity. Everything else is product
drift. GitHub closeout additionally proves, per covered task, one merged PR
whose current aggregate review decision is approved, that closes the correct
issue, and that lands the certified candidate; historical approvals never
override a current change request. `github-ready` fails closed when the linked
issue is not the unique carrier of its task identity across open and closed
issues.

## Global diagnostics

`--debug` is a global flag accepted in flag position by every command. It prints
internal stack details for unexpected failures; normal output keeps those
details behind a stable debug reference. Set `AGENTICLOOP_DEBUG=1` for the same
behavior in automation. Do not publish debug output without reviewing it for
paths, environment details, or other sensitive operational context.

### A refusal class the catalog cannot express

Every diagnostic resolves to a repair kind that asks a workflow role to change
*project* state, and to an escalation kind that routes the result. None of them
means "the fact this refusal rests on was derived incorrectly by the toolkit".
A derivation fault therefore surfaces as an ordinary evidence refusal - in the
field, `role_return.invalid` with `repairKind: repair_evidence` and
`escalationKind: none` - and the role is asked to repair evidence that is
already correct.

The human channel the fault belongs to, `human_authority_disposition`, exists
and other rows reach it; no row reaches it for this reason. The gap is declared
in the catalog itself as `UNEXPRESSED_REFUSAL_CLASS` so a consumer can read it
where the rest of the routing lives. Adding the diagnostic family requires an
owner amendment and is carried as P37-01-C7, with the auditable override it
implies as P37-01-C8.

Until then, an operator who believes a refusal rests on a wrongly derived fact
should treat it as an operator decision rather than role work, and should not
read `repair_evidence` as a statement that the project's records are wrong.

## Exit statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | Success, safe no-op, displayed help/version, or explicit cancellation before apply |
| `1` | Operational, configuration, generation, validation, or apply failure |
| `2` | Invalid command-line usage (unknown option/command, missing or invalid value) |
| `130` | User interruption propagated through the CLI cancellation contract |

Scripts may continue to treat any nonzero status as failure. Strict parsing
and the `1` → `2` usage-status split are deliberate compatibility changes;
see `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Verbosity, color, CI, and non-TTY behavior

- `--verbose` changes detail, never behavior.
- Color is semantic, optional, auto-detected, and respects `NO_COLOR`. Words
  and exit statuses remain authoritative; color never replaces them.
- Progress indicators appear only for genuinely slow operations and are
  disabled for non-TTY, CI, JSON, and redirected output.
- TTY, non-TTY, CI, and redirected output are all plain, grep-able text.

## Compatibility aliases and deprecations

| Form | Status |
|---|---|
| `setup --yes` | Retained compatibility alias for `setup --non-interactive` (preferred) |
| `upgrade` | Alias for `update` |
| `event` | Alias for `event-logging` |
| `init --opencode` | Alias for `init --adapter opencode` |
| `init --setup` | **Deprecated**; use `agenticloop setup --adapter <host>`. Behavior unchanged during the deprecation window |
| `pr-body lint --input <evaluation-input.json>` | **Deprecated** compatibility mode for complete serialized preparation input. Use `pr-body lint --pr <n> --body-file <path>` live or `pr-body lint --snapshot <path> --body-file <path>` offline; removal requires a separately approved breaking release |
| `init --update-assets` | Removed; use `agenticloop update` |
| `--no-agents-guidance` | Opt out of the activation-guidance block (literal option on init/setup) |

Strict-parsing compatibility changes (unknown options fail, Boolean flags do
not consume following tokens, command-local `-h` prints help, usage failures
exit `2`) are recorded in `CHANGELOG.md`.
