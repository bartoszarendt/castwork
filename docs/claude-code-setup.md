# Claude Code Setup

Status: supported.

Claude Code now has two independent Agentic Loop install modes that share the
same canonical source:

- `agenticloop/commands/start.md`
- `agenticloop/agents/<role>.md`
- `agenticloop/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
- `agenticloop/backends/<name>.md`

`agenticloop/commands/`, `agenticloop/agents/`, and `agenticloop/skills/` stay canonical in both modes. The
difference is how Claude Code sees them.

## Activating Agentic Loop

Claude Code does not boot into Agentic Loop automatically. Activation is
explicit and human-invoked by slash command. This is intentional pull
activation, not a hook and not a managed `CLAUDE.md` override.

- Repo-local Mode B: run `/agenticloop [task-id or task description]`
- Plugin Mode A: run `/agenticloop:start [task-id or task description]`
- Repo-local Mode B stop: run `/agenticloop stop`
- Plugin Mode A stop: run `/agenticloop:stop`

Both commands read `.agenticloop/project.md` first, route or confirm setup when
`setup_status` is `unconfirmed` or `development_stage` is not human-confirmed,
and then enter the normal Agentic Loop flow.
Stop instead deactivates the current conversation before setup or task selection,
checkpoints unfinished work when needed, and does not perform closeout, commits,
pushes, merges, or worktree cleanup. Resume with the matching normal activation
command.

## Delegation Topology

Claude Code may expose multiple subagents, but Agentic Loop is serial by
default. Every authorized multi-task unit receives a current Parallel Opportunity
Scan after decomposition; fewer than two ready tasks still record a truthful
not-currently-eligible result and rescan trigger. Bounded eligible implementation
batches use at most the configured project maximum (default five), which is a
ceiling rather than a total-agent budget. The
orchestrator should not start parallel maintainer or engineer
subagents unless it records the concurrency plan, collision criteria, decision
scope, shared-design resolution, lease, and
join condition required by `agenticloop/skills/parallel-delegation/SKILL.md`.
Long-running parallelism has
stronger observability requirements than short bounded join-based batches.
Parallel write lanes that mutate
repository files require a separate `git worktree` and branch per lane; a branch
alone is not sufficient in a shared checkout. The lease progress checkpoint is a
return-to-orchestrator checkpoint cadence, not an async heartbeat, unless the
host exposes running-subagent status.

Launch Claude Code sessions that run Agentic Loop with non-interactive Git
environment variables (`GIT_EDITOR=true`, `GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR=true`,
`GIT_PAGER=cat`, `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0`, `GH_EDITOR=true`, `GH_PAGER=cat`,
`GH_PROMPT_DISABLED=1`) as described in
[Host Adapters](host-adapters.md#non-interactive-git-environment). This prevents
unattended lanes from blocking on `COMMIT_EDITMSG`, interactive rebase todo
files, pagers, PR prompts, or credential prompts.

## Mode A - Install Agentic Loop as a Claude Code Plugin

Use this when you want one shared Agentic Loop install across many target
projects.

- The plugin packaging lives only in this toolkit repo under `.claude-plugin/`.
- Claude Code reads the canonical `agenticloop/commands/start.md` activation command and the
  canonical `agenticloop/agents/` role agents directly.
- The plugin does not ship copied skill payloads under `.claude-plugin/`.
  `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` overrides plugin skill discovery away from the
  canonical `agenticloop/skills/` directory so the internal Agentic Loop procedures do not
  appear as separate public plugin skills.
- The activation command and canonical role agents resolve internal procedures
  by explicit canonical paths such as `agenticloop/skills/blocked-state/SKILL.md`.
- Target projects do not get generated `.claude/` copies from this mode.
- Plugin agents inherit the user's active Claude Code model because the
  canonical `agenticloop/agents/*.md` files stay model-free.

### Local Development Install

From Claude Code:

```text
/plugin marketplace add /path/to/agenticloop
/plugin install agenticloop@agenticloop-dev
/agents
```

`/agents` should show the three namespaced plugin agents:
`agenticloop:orchestrator`, `agenticloop:maintainer`, and
`agenticloop:engineer`. Use `/agenticloop:start` to activate Agentic Loop in the
current conversation.

### Future Published Marketplace Install

Once the toolkit is published as a GitHub-backed marketplace, the install flow
becomes:

```text
/plugin marketplace add bartoszarendt/agenticloop
/plugin install agenticloop@agenticloop-dev
```

## Mode B - Generate a Repo-Local Claude Code Adapter

Use this when one target project needs checked-in Claude Code agent files and
repo-specific model settings.

Generate the repo-local adapter with:

```text
npx agenticloop init --target <target-project-root> --adapter claude-code
```

This creates:

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `agenticloop.json` | Target-owned adapter config with per-role `adapters.claude-code.roleSettings`. |
| `agenticloop/config.json` | Toolkit-owned structural defaults. |
| `.claude/commands/agenticloop.md` | Repo-local explicit activation command for `/agenticloop`. |
| `.claude/agents/<role>.md` | Generated Claude Code agents rendered from canonical role files. |
| `.claude/skills/agenticloop/SKILL.md` | One public Agentic Loop activation skill rendered from the canonical start command. |
| `.claude/skills/agenticloop/references/skills/<name>/reference.md` | Internal procedure copies of each canonical skill, renamed from `SKILL.md` so they are not separate discoverable Claude skills. |
| `.claude/settings.local.json` | Default local Claude Code permissions file. Set `scope: "project"` to write shared `.claude/settings.json` instead. |

Mode B never generates `.claude-plugin/`.

Mode B exposes exactly one public Claude skill (`agenticloop`). The internal
Agentic Loop procedures are not separate public Claude skills: each canonical
`agenticloop/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` is copied under
`.claude/skills/agenticloop/references/skills/<name>/reference.md` and renamed to
`reference.md` so the Claude skill picker only shows the single `agenticloop`
entry. The public skill body links to those reference files by path. The
`agenticloop` skill directory is fully owned and regenerated by Agentic Loop;
target-owned skills in sibling `.claude/skills/<other>/` directories are left
untouched.

The generated `.claude/agents/<role>.md` subagents also point at those reference
files: each role lists its required procedures by
`.claude/skills/agenticloop/references/skills/<name>/reference.md` path, and the
canonical `[[name]]` markers in role bodies are rewritten to the same paths so a
delegated maintainer or engineer never depends on a skill name that is not a
discoverable Mode B skill.

Mode B keeps two activation surfaces that share one intent and stay consistent:
the `/agenticloop` slash command (`.claude/commands/agenticloop.md`) is the
explicit human entry point, while the `agenticloop` skill is the model-facing
surface that owns the reference index. The skill is generated with
`disable-model-invocation: true`, so it does not auto-trigger; activation stays
human-invoked through the command.

Refresh the repo-local adapter with:

```text
npx agenticloop generate claude-code --target <target-project-root>
```

In Claude Code, run `/agenticloop` to activate Agentic Loop for that repo-local
target.

### Repo-Local Model Settings

Mode B keeps per-repo model settings in `agenticloop.json` under
`adapters.claude-code.roleSettings.<role>`. The `model` value is rendered into
the generated `.claude/agents/*.md` frontmatter.

```json
{
  "adapters": {
    "claude-code": {
      "roleSettings": {
        "orchestrator": { "model": "<claude-orchestrator-model>" },
        "maintainer":   { "model": "<claude-maintainer-model>" },
        "engineer":     { "model": "<claude-engineer-model>" },
        "auditor":      { "model": "<claude-auditor-model>" }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Use a Claude Code model alias supported by your installed Claude Code version,
or a full model id. `reasoningEffort` is not used here: Claude Code subagent frontmatter
can carry `name`/`description`/`tools`/`model`/`permissionMode`, but not
reasoning effort, so the adapter does not render an `effort:` field.
(reasoningEffort still applies to the OpenCode and Codex adapters.)

Do not add Claude Code model fields to canonical `agenticloop/agents/*.md`.

### Permissions

Mode B generated `maintainer` and `engineer` subagents use
`permissionMode: "acceptEdits"` by default. That scopes edit auto-accept to
Agentic Loop worker subagents, not every Claude Code session in the repo.

The generated `auditor` subagent uses `permissionMode: "plan"` by default.
`plan` is Claude Code's supported non-editing mode, so the auditor's read-only
posture is enforced mechanically rather than by prompt text alone. The auditor
still reads the repository, task records, decisions, and evidence, and returns a
structured report the orchestrator persists with `npx agenticloop audit report`.
Capability declarations are derived from the effective final
`permissionMode`, including target overrides. Changing a non-implementing role
to `acceptEdits` therefore removes the enforced mutation-denial claim and
renders that restriction advisory.

The orchestrator or main session is not granted `acceptEdits` by default. Keep
that main session as the coordinator and delegate writes or Bash-heavy work to
the maintainer or engineer.

Mode B also writes a Claude Code permissions config. The base config uses the
built-in `agenticloop` profile:

```json
{
  "adapters": {
    "claude-code": {
      "permissions": {
        "profile": "agenticloop",
        "scope": "local",
        "deny": []
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `agenticloop` profile is intentionally broad enough for normal Agentic Loop
task implementation. It includes Bash and PowerShell allowlist entries for
common `git`, `gh`, `npm`, `npx`, `pytest`, `ruff`, and `alembic` commands,
plus common Agentic Loop verification commands.

`scope: "local"` writes `.claude/settings.local.json`. That is the recommended
autonomy path because the broader rules stay machine-local, project-local, and
normally untracked. Agentic Loop also adds `.claude/settings.local.json` to the
target root `.gitignore` automatically.

Targets that intentionally want shared team settings may set
`scope: "project"`, which writes `.claude/settings.json` instead.

Agentic Loop does not set `permissions.defaultMode` by default, because that
would affect every Claude Code session in the repo, not only Agentic Loop
subagents.

PowerShell entries are included because Claude Code's PowerShell tool is
separate from Bash. They matter when PowerShell tool support is enabled.

If a target project accepts project-wide default permission behavior, set
`adapters.claude-code.permissions.defaultMode` explicitly in
`agenticloop.json`.

If a target project wants to manage Claude Code settings itself, set
`adapters.claude-code.permissions = false` to opt out of
Claude Code settings generation.

Mode A plugin limitation: plugin subagents ignore generated repo-local
`permissionMode`, so users must configure their own Claude Code settings or
launch flags if they want relaxed permissions there.

These Claude Code permissions are separate from Agentic Loop workflow gates.
Task records, delegation boundaries, blocked-state handling, review, and
acceptance still follow the normal Agentic Loop process.

### GitHub CLI Body Files

When Claude Code uses `gh` to create or update GitHub issues, pull requests, or
comments, write the Markdown body to a temp file under `.agenticloop/tmp/` and pass it with
`gh --body-file <path>`. Avoid heredocs and long inline `--body` strings.

## Which Mode To Use

- Use Mode A when you want one reusable Claude Code install across many target
  projects and you are happy to inherit the active Claude Code model.
- Use Mode B when a single target project needs checked-in `.claude/` artifacts
  and per-repo `roleSettings` for the model.

## Validation

For Mode B, `npx agenticloop validate` checks Claude Code output only when
`.claude/agents/` is present, when the adapter is marked `enabled: true` or
`required: true`, or when you pass `--adapter claude-code`.

```text
npx agenticloop validate --adapter claude-code
```

For Mode A plugin packaging at the toolkit root, validate the plugin directly
with Claude Code:

```text
claude plugin validate --strict .claude-plugin/plugin.json
```

See [docs/host-adapters.md](host-adapters.md) for the adapter status table.
