/**
 * What every persisted evidence class is for, and who is allowed to see it.
 *
 * Two requirements meet here. The platform-safety work asked for a storage taxonomy, because Agentic
 * Loop wrote generated state under `.agenticloop/` and then rejected it at the
 * clean gate - a class confusion, not a bug in either component. And the
 * remediation's governing principle asks the harder question of every field:
 *
 * > Rich internal state must produce a simpler external workflow. Every
 * > persisted field must have at least one named consumer and support a
 * > decision, invariant, recovery operation, audit claim, coordination
 * > boundary, or bounded analysis. Otherwise it must be derived, transient, or
 * > removed.
 *
 * A record kept because it might be useful later is a record nobody maintains
 * and everybody has to reason about. So each class below names its producer,
 * its consumer, the decision it changes, whether it could be derived instead,
 * how long it must survive, which storage class it belongs to, and the bounded
 * projection each role receives.
 *
 * The last field is the one that does work at runtime. An Engineer does not
 * need activation internals, audit records, or closeout state to implement a
 * bounded change; handing them over enlarges the context it must reason about
 * and the surface it might act on, for no implementation benefit. `visibleTo`
 * is that boundary, stated per class rather than per call site.
 *
 * This inventory is checked against the source's own storage roots, so it
 * cannot quietly go stale while the code grows a new class.
 */

/**
 * The four storage classes.
 *
 * The clean-gate rule is the reason the taxonomy exists: a command must not
 * write ordinary output into a class its next required gate rejects.
