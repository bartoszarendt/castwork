/**
 * The canonical lifecycle-dispatchability gate.
 *
 * Preflight, packet preparation, prepared-packet validation, and role-start
 * recognition all need one identical answer to "may this task begin an
 * execution attempt right now?". Before the lifecycle gate existed only the last of them asked:
 * preflight and `prepare-dispatch` reported success for a `draft` task, and the
 * refusal arrived at role start, inside the Engineer session, as an illegal
 * lifecycle transition. That handed Maintainer-owned readiness work to
 * the wrong role and started the repair cascade the field sessions measured.
 *
 * The rule is derived from the one legal-transition authority rather than being
 * restated here, so it cannot drift from what role start will actually accept:
 * a task is dispatchable exactly when its current status can legally reach
 * `in-progress`, or already is `in-progress`.

/**
 * The structured repair for one lifecycle refusal.
 *
 * Repairs used to be free-text strings assembled at each refusal site, and the
 * `draft` string was not a runnable command at all: it named a `task set-status`
 * subcommand that does not exist, omitted the required `--expect-digest`, and
 * offered `--base` and `--base-paths` together even though `task status` refuses
 * both. A string cannot be checked; a structure can.
 *
 * So every refusal produces one record instead:
 *
 * - `code`          - the diagnostic identity, shared by every boundary.
 * - `prerequisite`  - the exact fact that must become true.
 * - `reads`         - read-only commands that supply a placeholder value.
 * - `primary`       - at most one command, executable once its declared
 *                     placeholders are replaced and nothing else.
 * - `alternatives`  - a separate command only where the choice is genuinely the
 *                     operator's, each with the condition that selects it.
 * - `statement`     - what is true, for the statuses where no command is safe.
 *
 * Owner and category are deliberately absent: `REPAIR_POLICY` already derives
 * them from `code`, and `createDiagnostic` refuses an evaluator-supplied owner.
 *
 * @typedef {{ command: string, placeholders: string[] }} RepairCommand
 * @typedef {{
 *   code: string,
 *   status: string|null,
