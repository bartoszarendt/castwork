/**
 * Whose work is one commit?
 *
 * This is a different question from whether a commit's attribution is canonical
 * for the role returning now, and the two must not stand in for each other. The
 * attribution gate below asks "is this commit's trailer block valid?" and
 * refuses when it is not. This asks "did this task's own work produce this
 * commit?", and only that answer decides what the task's scope gate is entitled
 * to ask about.
 *
 * - `claimed`   - the final contiguous trailer block names exactly this task.
 * - `other`     - it names another task, or carries no Task trailer at all: the
 *                 toolkit update an operator ran, a merge, a lockfile refresh.
 * - `ambiguous` - a Task trailer is present but does not resolve to one task,
 *                 or was stranded outside the final block by `git commit -m … -m …`.
 *                 Undecidable ownership resolves toward the task, never away
 *                 from it, so an ambiguous commit's paths still face the gate.
 *
 * Note what is deliberately absent: the commit's paths. Four field cohorts
 * established that path classification cannot answer an ownership question -
 * `agenticloop.json`, `.gitignore`, `package.json`, and `package-lock.json`
 * genuinely belong to the target, so no classifier can exempt them without
 * hiding real task edits to real files.
