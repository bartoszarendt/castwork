/**
 * Execution-attempt identity and packet conservation.
 *
 * A dispatch packet is not a ticket that can be reissued. It is the evidence
 * that one specific execution attempt started from one specific product base,
 * and once an Engineer has mutated anything under it, that evidence is the only
 * thing that can still explain what the mutation was relative to.
 *
 * The field record shows what happens without that rule. The field session dispatched
 * before readiness was settled, then minted fresh packets and repaired history
 * after implementation, until no retained packet represented the start of the
 * work that had actually been done. `prepare-return` then had nothing truthful
 * to bind, and the task ended `blocked` at return production. The session
 * concluded that same-checkout return was structurally impossible; it was not.
 * The lineage had been destroyed, not proven absent.
 *
 * So this module answers one question - **may a new packet be consumed for this
 * task right now?** - from durable evidence only:
 *
 * - No prior consumption: this is a first attempt. Allowed.
 * - A prior attempt exists and was explicitly abandoned: allowed, as a new
 *   attempt, with the abandoned one still on record.
 * - A prior attempt exists, is live, and the Engineer has mutated nothing yet:
 *   allowed. Nothing has been built against the old base, so nothing is lost.
 * - A prior attempt exists, is live, and the Engineer has mutated something:
 *   **refused**. The attempt reaches a canonical return or it is explicitly
 *   abandoned; it is never silently replaced.
 *
 * The last case is the invariant. It costs an operator one explicit command in
 * the rare case, and it makes "no retained packet represents this work" a state
 * the protocol cannot reach by accident.
 *
 * What this module does *not* do: it never decides that an attempt succeeded,
 * never writes anything, and never infers abandonment from silence. An
 * abandonment is an authored record or it did not happen.
