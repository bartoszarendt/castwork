/**
 * Bounded operational measurement, derived and never stored.
 *
 * The field session was measured from outside and the process was found spending more effort
 * on its own evidence than on the product task: 26 `prepare-return` calls, all
 * failing; 31 `prepare-dispatch` calls, 18 failing; repeated role invocations
 * including empty returns. None of that was visible from inside the run. The
 * remediation asks for those numbers back - but with one constraint that shapes
 * the whole design:
 *
 * > Telemetry is not task evidence and must not become a second workflow truth
 * > store.
 *
 * The cheapest way to honour a constraint is to make violating it impossible,
 * so this module **persists nothing**. Every counter is derived, on demand,
 * from durable evidence that already exists for its own reasons: consumption
 * records, abandonment records, carrier mutation receipts, adoption records.
 * There is no writer here, no schema to drift, and no second place a reader
 * could mistake for the truth. Delete the derived output and nothing is lost.
 *
 * It is also privacy-clean by construction rather than by policy. The inputs
 * are identities, counts, and instants. There is no path by which a prompt,
 * a reasoning trace, a shell log, a diff, or a free-text reason enters a
 * measurement: the reader below never reads a task body, a commit message, or
 * an abandonment's stated reason, and the projection has no field to put one in.
 *
 * What it deliberately does not do: it never decides anything. A deviation from
 * the ordinary shape is reported, not enforced. The operational targets are
 * measurement targets, and a missed target is a fact for a human to weigh, not
 * a gate that blocks work.
