/**
 * Deriving a per-task execution lease from work-unit intent already given.
 *
 * The field operator complaint, stated precisely: a milestone of eight tasks
 * read as eight interactive confirmations. Surfacing `--work-unit` in every
 * refusal (see `activation-repair.js`) fixes the *discovery* half of that. This
 * is the other half - what happens to a task that becomes ready **after** the
 * operator authorized the work unit it belongs to.
 *
 * Today a work-unit grant derives child bindings from committed decomposition
 * membership at the moment activation runs. A task that reaches the ready set
 * later is inside the operator's stated intent but outside the derived set, so
 * it asks again. That is the reconfirmation the remediation asks to remove.
 *
 * The rule that makes removing it safe is narrow, and the narrowness is the
 * point:
 *
 * > A lease may be derived without a new operator action **only** for a task
 * > inside the exact scope the operator confirmed.
 *
 * "Exact" means the scope digest the grant bound. A task added to the work unit
 * after confirmation was not authorized - the operator never saw it - so scope
 * expansion always requires a new confirmation. Without that, "authorize the
 * milestone" would quietly become "authorize whatever anyone later files under
 * this milestone", which is a materially different thing to consent to.
 *
 * This module decides eligibility only. It mints nothing: the authenticated
 * binding is still produced by the activation path from committed decomposition
 * evidence, so a derived lease remains traceable to the operator's grant and is
 * never model-authored.
