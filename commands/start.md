<!-- AGENTICLOOP_ADAPTER_SLOT:activation_capability -->
Activation adapter: `claude-code.plugin.command.v1`.
Activation capture capability: `unsupported`.

This file is the live Claude Code plugin command `/agenticloop:start`, registered
through `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`. The Claude Code plugin surface has no
host-owned parser capture channel, so model-visible command arguments are
advisory context only and are never activation proof. Do not serialize the
substituted argument, the surrounding prompt, or any other model-visible text
into activation capture JSON.
<!-- /AGENTICLOOP_ADAPTER_SLOT:activation_capability -->

Each generated host artifact replaces the capability slot above with its own
adapter's declaration. Every shipped host declares `unsupported`, and that never
changes from inside a session: prompt-visible input must never be converted into
capture JSON.

`unsupported` is not the end of the workflow. It only means this host cannot
*itself* prove activation. The universal path is one explicit operator action
outside the agent session:

```
npx agenticloop activate T-016 T-017
npx agenticloop activate --work-unit <work-unit-id>
```

That command runs in the operator's own terminal, shows the exact tasks,
carriers, contract digests, repository, work unit, and resulting assurance, and
requires the operator to type a confirmation. It never rewrites a task record,
so existing task ids, bodies, history, and decomposition state are preserved.

When a task you need is not activated, do not stop the session and do not
attempt to author activation evidence. Report the blocked activation state, tell
the operator the exact command above, and continue in the same project and
session once they have run it. Activation assurance is then
`operator_confirmed` and role returns are `session_reported` - honest grades
that are not host-authenticated and must never be described as if they were.
Hardened projects still require a registered protected host adapter.
Activation and return adapters are independent, and capability declarations are
not evidence that either event occurred. Hardened closeout requires an observed
authenticated host receipt.

Before any setup check, orientation, document loading, task selection, or
delegation, normalize the supplied argument by trimming surrounding whitespace.
If and only if it equals `stop` (case-insensitive), immediately follow
`agenticloop/commands/stop.md` and return. Do not continue this start workflow.
`stop now`, `stop-gap fix`, and other non-exact task or context arguments are
ordinary inputs, not deactivation requests. Do not treat `exit` as an alias.

Path convention: toolkit source (`AGENTIC_LOOP.md`, `agents/`, `skills/`,
`backends/`) lives under `agenticloop/` (no leading dot). Target project state
(`project.md`, `tasks/`, `decisions/`, `improvements/`) lives under `.agenticloop/` (leading
dot). `.agenticloop/agents`, `.agenticloop/skills`, and
`.agenticloop/backends` are invalid paths – canonical assets are always
under `agenticloop/` without the dot.
The active role contract is always under `agenticloop/agents/`.

Read `.agenticloop/project.md` first. If `setup_status` is `unconfirmed` or a
confirmed map lacks a valid human-confirmed `development_stage`, route
`agenticloop/skills/setup-agenticloop/SKILL.md` or confirm the profile before
selecting or creating the first task.

Then read `agenticloop/AGENTIC_LOOP.md`, the lifecycle-at-a-glance section, and
only the canonical role contract for the current action. Read the named protocol
or skill section on demand; do not preload every role, backend, or skill.
Keep the main session as the coordinator: it reads the selected project config
and process docs, routes task authoring, review, acceptance, and closeout
through the maintainer role, routes scoped implementation and revision work
through the engineer role, and should not directly edit implementation files
unless the human explicitly asks. Respect the Advance Authorization Boundary,
blocked-state handling, decision records, event logging rules, and configured
group approval gates.

Before running Git or `gh` in unattended role work, keep them non-interactive.
Prefer a host/session environment with `GIT_EDITOR=true`,
`GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR=true`, `GIT_PAGER=cat`, `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0`,
`GH_EDITOR=true`, `GH_PAGER=cat`, and `GH_PROMPT_DISABLED=1`; otherwise apply
equivalent per-command settings such as `git --no-pager ...`, explicit
`git commit -m/-F`, `gh pr create --title ... --body-file ...`, and
`git -c core.editor=true -c sequence.editor=true rebase --continue` after
resolved conflicts. Do not launch editor-backed Git or GitHub CLI commands that
can block on a human closing a message, todo, pager, or credential prompt.

Agentic Loop is serial by default. Do not run parallel maintainer or engineer
delegations unless the orchestrator records a concurrency plan and join
condition. Long-running or parallel role work must include a lease:
observable-step checkpoint cadence, no-progress budget, status-return stop
condition, and any relevant milestone or duration.

For every authorized multi-task unit, perform a current Parallel Opportunity
Scan after decomposition. With fewer than two ready tasks, record a truthful
not-currently-eligible result and rescan trigger. If 2 or more ready tasks are
independent on both the mutation and knowledge dimensions and collision criteria
are known and disjoint, prefer a bounded parallel implementation batch up to the
configured maximum; otherwise record the concrete serial reason or the two-wave
pattern for coupled work. The maximum is a ceiling only for implementation lanes.

Create or refine the durable task record before any implementation.

If no task ID or task description is provided:
1. Read `.agenticloop/project.md` and configured primary documents (rules,
   overview, process), plus any selected task-source documents (`plan`, `spec`,
   `design`, `context`) relevant to the work.
2. Check `setup_status`; if unconfirmed, route setup or confirmation first.
3. Inspect the active backend for candidate task records:
   - if `github`, look for open `agent-ready` issues when GitHub access works;
   - if `files`, look under the configured task directory.
4. Summarize current project and task state.
5. If exactly one open or ready task exists, propose it as the default candidate
   but do not silently start implementation unless the user clearly authorized
   that work unit.
6. If no open tasks exist, identify the likely next work item from the plan. If
   it is a phase, group, milestone, epic, or multi-deliverable item, report that
   it needs maintainer decomposition into task records. Do not create records
   without confirmation.
7. If GitHub is unreachable during bare orientation, still provide local project
   orientation from files and report GitHub as unavailable for task operations.
   Do not treat connector failure alone as proof of missing credentials.
8. Ask the human to select a task or provide a task description.

<!-- AGENTICLOOP_ADAPTER_SLOT:requested_input -->
Requested task or context: `$ARGUMENTS`

Claude Code substitutes this argument when `/agenticloop:start` is invoked. Treat
it as advisory context for orientation and task selection only; it is never
activation proof.
