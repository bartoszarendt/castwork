# Stop Agentic Loop

Stop means durable denial of future protected transitions for the active task,
plus current-conversation deactivation. It is not host-session exit, task
closeout, or worktree cleanup. Do not authorize or initiate new Agentic Loop work
or spawn new maintainer, engineer, or parallel-lane agents.

1. Identify the exact active task from current context and durable task state.
   Do not guess an ambiguous task. When one active task and activation binding
   exist, run `npx agenticloop activation stop <task-id> --reason "explicit Agentic Loop stop"`.
   This immutable binding denial must succeed before claiming the task is
   durably stopped. If no exact active task or binding exists, report that no
   durable stop was recorded.
2. Inspect active Agentic Loop subagents, delegated roles, background commands,
   and worktree lanes.
3. When the host exposes a safe interruption control, interrupt active Agentic
   Loop subagents or background work. When it does not, do not wait
   indefinitely; report the still-running work and host limitation.
   The durable stop blocks later protected transitions; it does not claim that
   this host interruption succeeded or that remote work was cancelled.
4. Preserve material unfinished work. Use the existing maintainer/delegation
   path when available. When progress is not yet durable, append a concise dated
   handoff/checkpoint note to the task record with the last completed action,
   current artifact, branch or worktree, verification already run, and the next
   concrete action. Keep the current task status unchanged unless an independent
   blocker actually exists. A voluntary stop is not `blocked` or `needs_context`.
5. If no task or delegated work is active, do not write a checkpoint.

Do not accept, close, merge, commit, push, delete branches, clean up worktrees,
or begin task closeout unless the user separately authorizes that action.

Return a final stop summary containing:

- Agentic Loop deactivated for this conversation.
- Active task ID, or `none`, and its durable status.
- Durable stop revocation ID and stopped binding ID, or the exact reason no
  durable stop was recorded.
- Interrupted work or still-running work with any host limitation.
- Checkpoint location, if one was needed.
- Branch or worktree when relevant.
- Exact resume invocation for the active host: `/agenticloop <task or context>`
  for OpenCode, Claude Code repo-local, Copilot CLI, and Cursor;
  `/agenticloop:start <task or context>` for Claude Code plugin; and
  `$agenticloop <task or context>` for Codex.

After this summary, do not automatically continue Agentic Loop for later user
messages. Resumption requires both the normal explicit host activation and a
fresh `npx agenticloop activate <task-id>` authorization. The old stop record
is never deleted, and an old packet remains refused.
