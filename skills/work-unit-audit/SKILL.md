# Work-unit audit

Task review proves each task was done correctly. Work-unit audit answers the
question no task review asks: does the *combined* result achieve the work unit's
intended outcome as a complete, coherent, sufficiently verified system?

Individually accepted tasks can still leave missing cross-task behavior, an
incomplete product outcome, conflicting configuration, duplicate mechanisms,
code and docs that disagree, unnecessary combined complexity, integrated
regressions, or task-level evidence that never proved the final combined state.

Work-unit audit is **enabled by default**. Unless a human explicitly records
`work_unit_audit: disabled` in `.agenticloop/project.md`, work-unit closeout
cannot publish `AGENT_CLOSEOUT_STATUS: complete` without a current certificate.

## 0. Entry guard

This skill governs Agentic Loop-mode work-unit certification. It applies when
the Auditor is invoked in Agentic Loop mode to certify or re-audit a tracked
work unit against a designated audit record or audit packet.

It does not automatically apply to a standalone Auditor assessment. A standalone
auditor takes its scope from the parent request, needs no audit packet, audit
record, covered-task set, or frozen candidate, and returns non-certifying
findings; it may consult this file as a reference without adopting the procedure.
A standalone assessment never satisfies the certification gate below.

## 1. Preconditions

Do not start an audit until all of the following hold:

- every covered task is `accepted` or `closed` under the configured backend;
- the covered artifacts are integrated or composed into one exact candidate;
- the candidate is frozen: a commit SHA or another immutable revision reference;
- final integrated verification evidence exists for that exact candidate;
- an Auditor model is configured at `adapters.<host>.roleSettings.auditor`.

If auditing is enabled and no Auditor model is configured, that is a blocking
setup condition. Report it and stop. Never substitute the Maintainer model.

Integration rehearsal and audit are different steps. Engineer-owned integration
rehearsal remains the pre-integration composition proof. The audit runs *after*
the exact candidate is integrated or frozen.

## 2. Audit packet

Each invocation receives only bounded durable context:

- the original work-unit goal and its durable source reference;
- the observable completion oracle;
- the confirmed development stage;
- the exact work-unit identity;
- the exact covered task IDs;
- task outcomes and inline completion summaries;
- relevant accepted decision records;
- the exact candidate artifact;
- final integrated verification evidence;
- known limitations and accepted follow-ups, with their authority references;
- bounded repository-discovery rules.

Never pass raw transcripts, full implementation conversations, or host runtime
dumps.

Create the record only with concrete packet inputs:

```text
npx agenticloop audit new --work-unit phase:4 \
  --covered-tasks T-041,T-042 --artifact commit:abc123 \
  --goal "<outcome and durable source>" \
  --completion-oracle "<observable completion>" \
  --evidence "<integrated evidence for commit:abc123>"
```

The CLI rejects missing goal, oracle, or evidence. The validator also rejects
instructional placeholder text, so a placeholder packet cannot be certified.

If the goal, completion oracle, baseline, or covered-task boundary is too
ambiguous to audit, the Auditor returns `needs_human_decision` and does not
invent the intended outcome.

## 3. Exact-baseline freezing

An audit binds to one exact artifact and one exact covered-task set. Record both
in the audit record:

```yaml
candidate_artifact: commit:abc123
covered_tasks:
  - T-041
  - T-042
```

Certification is current only when both hold:

```text
certified_artifact      == candidate_artifact
certified_covered_tasks == covered_tasks     (after canonical ordering)
```

Any relevant candidate change, any covered-task addition or removal, any change
to group membership, and any reopened covered task invalidates certification.
Reordering an otherwise identical task set does not.

## 4. Fresh invocation

Every audit and re-audit is a fresh, separate Auditor invocation. Allowed
invocation modes are `host_subagent` and `explicit_agent_invocation`.
`single_agent_fallback` is rejected: a same-session continuation re-reads its own
conclusions and is not an independent audit.

Each run records a unique invocation reference. A reused reference fails
validation. Never record the model id or reasoning effort in the audit record;
those stay adapter configuration.

An invocation that fails without producing a report does not consume
`audit_budget`. Repeated equivalent invocation failures stay bounded by
**Attempt And Review Budgets** in `agenticloop/commands/lifecycle-protocol.md`.

## 5. Six perspectives, one execution

One Auditor performs all six perspectives in one execution and returns one
consolidated report. These are perspectives inside one audit, not separate
roles, agents, models, events, votes, or budgets.

1. **Outcome** - does the integrated result achieve the intended user, product,
   or operational outcome?
2. **Completeness** - are material requirements, behavior, documentation,
   migration, or operational steps missing?
3. **Integration and coherence** - do all task outputs work together without
   conflict, duplication, incompatible assumptions, or a second source of truth?
4. **Engineering quality** - is the combined solution appropriately simple,
   maintainable, and suitable for the confirmed development stage?
5. **Verification** - does the evidence prove the exact integrated candidate,
   rather than only proving individual tasks?
6. **Risk** - are there combined-state regressions, security issues, destructive
   failure modes, compatibility problems, data risks, or release and operational
   gaps?

Evaluate quality, verification, and risk at work-unit altitude. Do not re-review
an accepted task implementation merely because a different local choice was
available.

The Auditor may inspect evidence and run safe, bounded, non-publishing checks
against the frozen candidate. It never repairs a failure. Missing or inadequate
evidence becomes a finding routed to normal remediation.

## 6. Finding shape

Every finding carries:

```text
### A-01

- Severity: critical | high | medium | low
- Blocking: true | false
- Claim: concise problem statement
- Evidence refs: exact task/artifact/file/check references
- Consequence: concrete result if left unresolved
- Required outcome: observable result required for closure
- Verification required: exact evidence needed after remediation
```

## 7. Verdicts

Exactly one verdict per report:

- `certified`
- `certified_with_accepted_limitations`
- `needs_remediation`
- `needs_human_decision`

Rules:

- `certified` requires no open blocking findings.
- `certified_with_accepted_limitations` requires an existing human or
  accepted-decision authority reference for every retained limitation. Use
  `human: <identity>` for direct human authority or a `D-...` reference to an
  existing accepted decision record; arbitrary prose and Auditor self-authority
  are invalid.
- The Auditor may recommend accepting a new limitation but cannot accept one. A
  newly proposed limitation without authority returns `needs_human_decision`.
- `needs_human_decision` moves the record to `audit_state: awaiting_human`.
  No further report can be appended until the human direction is recorded:

```text
npx agenticloop audit resolve <AUD-ID> \
  --authority "human: <identity>" \
  --note "<decision and direction for remediation or re-audit>"
```

- After resolution, refresh the audit packet or baseline as needed and use a
  fresh Auditor invocation. The extra run is deliberate: the authority context
  changed. Resolution itself never certifies the work unit.
- The Maintainer may reject a finding with counter-evidence, but the finding
  stays unresolved until a fresh Auditor accepts that disposition or a human
  resolves the authority conflict.

## 8. Report persistence

The Auditor never needs implementation-write permission to produce a durable
report:

1. The Auditor returns a structured report to the orchestrator.
2. The orchestrator (or a human) persists it mechanically:

```text
npx agenticloop audit report <AUD-ID> --file .agenticloop/tmp/AUD-001-run-1.json
# PowerShell-safe alternative:
Get-Content -Raw '.agenticloop/tmp/AUD-001-run-1.json' |
  npx agenticloop audit report <AUD-ID> --stdin
```

The input is exactly one `auditor_report_v1` JSON object from `agents/auditor.md`:
all six named perspectives, exact artifact and task set, invocation object,
assessment, evidence, verdict, and complete finding fields are required. Unknown
top-level, invocation, perspective, or finding fields fail rather than being
discarded. Multiline substantive text persists in the fenced JSON payload.

Persistence appends one history entry and rewrites only derived certification
fields. It never edits an earlier history entry or alters report substance. A
fresh return is graded under the effective assurance policy. Standard mode
accepts an honestly receipt-free, separately invoked Auditor report as
`session_reported` and persists `Producer authenticated: false`. Hardened mode
requires the packaged production verifier injected by an authenticated protected
host boundary. The verifier consumes the fixed operator-pinned trust store and
authenticates a closed Ed25519 receipt binding the Auditor role, adapter/key,
target, invocation, work unit, candidate, canonical task inventory, exact
substantive report digest, receipt identity, and liveness. Shape and signature
are checked before semantic or freshness classification. A supplied opaque
receipt is never degraded proof.

Both grades bind the exact invocation reference and mode, work unit, candidate,
covered tasks, normalized report digest, and repository state revalidated at
persistence and closeout. Audit schema version 3 stores the grade and producer
authentication boolean; the audit gate, closeout packet, and final closeout
marker carry them and enforce the current policy minimum. Same-session audit is
invalid in both modes. Standard mode does not cryptographically establish the
Auditor identity, so every human and JSON surface must preserve that limitation.

The signed report digest covers the CLI's *normalized* report, so a protected
host prepares the report before it signs: it calls
`prepareAuditorReturnReportForSigning(rawReport)`, signs the returned digest,
inserts the receipt into the returned normalized report, and submits that. A
digest taken over the raw wire document is a different identity and is refused
even when the signature itself is genuine. The loader challenge that admits the
verifier is itself time-bounded: a response returned at or after the challenge's
`expiresAt` is refused however well it is signed. Invocation references, receipt bytes, and receipt
identities are unique across every audit record before a write, so a successful
mutation leaves audit lint clean. `legacy_inline_v1` remains compatible but is
not lossless wire provenance.

## 9. Remediation routing

For `needs_remediation`, or after a `needs_human_decision` verdict has been
resolved:

1. The orchestrator routes the report to the maintainer.
2. The maintainer gives each blocking finding one disposition: ordinary
   remediation task, change request, human decision, rejected with
   counter-evidence, previously accepted limitation, or non-blocking follow-up.
3. The engineer implements ordinary remediation tasks under [[tdd-implementation]]
   and [[verification-evidence]].
4. The maintainer reviews and accepts them normally under [[review-and-accept]].
5. The exact remediation result is integrated.

Remediation tasks are ordinary task records with their own `attempt_budget` and
`review_budget`. They reference the audit ID and the finding IDs they close.
Remediation never consumes `audit_budget`.

## 10. Re-audit

After remediation is accepted and integrated:

```text
npx agenticloop audit baseline <AUD-ID> --artifact commit:<new-sha> \
  --covered-tasks T-041,T-042,T-055 \
  --evidence "<integrated evidence for the new candidate>"
```

This refreshes the candidate artifact and covered-task boundary and clears any
stale certification. History is preserved: replacing the baseline never resets
the budget, and replacing the audit record is not an accepted way to reset it
either.

Then invoke a fresh Auditor and append the new report to the same audit record.

## 11. Audit budget

`audit_budget` defaults to `3`, after explicit `audit new --budget` and project
`default_audit_budget` are considered. It is independent of default-5
`attempt_budget` and default-5 `review_budget` checkpoint threshold.

- Count only completed substantive reports, derived from `## Audit History`.
- Count both certifying and non-certifying reports, but stop immediately after
  certification.
- Invocation failures without a report, rejected or malformed reports, and
  report-validation failures do not consume it; the normal attempt budget still
  bounds equivalent failures.
- Remediation work does not consume it.
- Baseline replacement does not reset history.
- The shared contract declares one bounded `product_invalidation_recovery`
  allowance per audit record, but it is not operationally enforced yet. Current
  executable behavior derives consumption from `## Audit History`, so every
  completed substantive report consumes `audit_budget`, including a rerun caused
  by product invalidation. After exhaustion, use the existing human-approved
  override. Agents must not claim or attempt a non-consuming recovery until the
  guarded audit mechanism supports it.
- Future guarded support must retain exactly one allowance, a typed cause, an
  invalidation reference, the affected prior run, and a Maintainer-recorded
  cause. Auditor findings cannot use it; a second recovery requires explicit
  human override.

After three non-certifying reports, set `audit_state: blocked` with
`audit_blocked_reason: audit_budget_exhausted` and keep `latest_verdict` at the
third Auditor's actual verdict. Budget exhaustion is a workflow stop, not an
Auditor verdict: never manufacture `needs_human_decision` merely because the
budget ran out. If the third verdict actually is `needs_human_decision`, keep
the record in `awaiting_human` until `audit resolve`; after resolution the
exhausted-budget block remains. A fourth report requires all applicable
resolution and a recorded human-approved override:

```text
npx agenticloop audit override <AUD-ID> --budget 7 --authority "human: <name>"
```

The CLI enforces append-only history operationally and validation checks internal
history consistency. That is not a claim of tamper-proof enforcement against
arbitrary manual Git history rewriting.

## 12. Closeout certification

Before the final candidate is frozen, the Maintainer completes any conditional
source-plan progress synchronization required by [[task-closeout]]. That plan
edit changes the candidate artifact, so the audit baseline and final Auditor
report must be bound to the resulting artifact. Do not edit the plan after a
current certificate without refreshing the baseline and certification.

When `work_unit_audit` resolves to `enabled`, work-unit closeout may publish
`AGENT_CLOSEOUT_STATUS: complete` only when all of these hold:

- exactly one current audit record exists for the work unit;
- covered-task membership is exact;
- all covered implementation and remediation tasks are accepted and integrated;
- `latest_verdict` is `certified` or `certified_with_accepted_limitations`;
- `audit_state` is `certified`;
- `certified_artifact` equals `candidate_artifact`;
- `certified_covered_tasks` equals `covered_tasks`;
- the last completed run's artifact, covered-task set, and verdict match the
  current certification fields;
- no blocking finding is unresolved;
- every accepted limitation has typed human authority or an existing accepted
  decision reference;
- fresh final-state evidence exists for the exact candidate.
- the complete audit record passes structural validation.

Enforce the gate mechanically:

```text
npx agenticloop audit gate <work-unit-or-audit-id>
```

Use `audit status` for diagnostics. Do not replace `audit gate` with a manual
frontmatter inspection.

Otherwise keep the marker at `follow_up_required`, or retain the appropriate
incomplete, blocked, or needs-context state. Publish one final closeout marker
for the work unit, not one marker per audit run. See [[task-closeout]].

When `work_unit_audit` is explicitly `disabled`, closeout bypasses this gate,
preserves any existing audit history, does not claim the work unit is certified,
and states the opt-out visibly in the closeout evidence.

## Work-unit identity

Grouped projects reuse the existing grouping semantics from
`.agenticloop/project.md`:

```text
phase:4
milestone:M2
epic:payments
custom:<group-id>
```

Flat projects require an explicit human-named unit, `work-unit:<name>`, plus
explicit covered task IDs. When durable group membership cannot be derived
reliably for a backend, require explicit covered tasks rather than guessing.

## Out of scope

Multi-model auditing, reviewer panels, voting, synthesis, provider diversity, and
primary/secondary Auditor slots are deliberately deferred. One work unit, one
Auditor, one model, one report per run.
