# GitHub attribution

This skill applies only when `task_backend: github` is set. Files-backed
projects do not post GitHub bodies or comments and do not use these trailers; see
`agenticloop/backends/files.md`.

When multiple agent roles share one GitHub token, GitHub's author field cannot identify which role wrote a comment. Agentic Loop uses a cooperative text trailer for role attribution.

This is not cryptographic. Treat missing or malformed attribution as `unknown`.

## Body trailer

End every agent-authored issue, pull request, or comment body with one final line:

```text
[[agent: orchestrator]]
[[agent: maintainer]]
[[agent: engineer]]
```

Use exactly one actual authoring role. Put the trailer after a blank line at the
end of the body. The accepted forms are `[[agent: engineer]]`,
`[[agent: maintainer]]`, and `[[agent: orchestrator]]`.

## Commit trailer

End every agent-authored commit message with:

```text
Task: T-001
Agent: engineer
```

Use the linked issue's non-empty frontmatter `task_id` when it exists. For a
legacy issue without `task_id`, use its number instead, for example:

```text
Task: #42
Agent: engineer
```

The body role and `Agent:` value must agree exactly. The `Agent:` value must be
the exact lowercase canonical `roleId`; a capitalized spelling such as
`Agent: Engineer` is rejected. The repair shape is always one final body trailer
`[[agent: <role>]]` and one final commit trailer pair
`Task: <resolved task id>` / `Agent: <role>`.

## Prospective commit flow

Do not hand-author a product message. `task commit-message` writes it with the
canonical trailer block already in place. Protected lifecycle commands commit
their own bounded workflow evidence and dispositions; never stage or combine
those paths manually.

```text
npx agenticloop task commit-message <task-id> --class product_implementation --subject <text> --output .agenticloop/tmp/<task>-commit-message.txt
npx agenticloop commit-attribution check --task <task-id> --message-file .agenticloop/tmp/<task>-commit-message.txt
git commit -F .agenticloop/tmp/<task>-commit-message.txt
npx agenticloop commit-attribution check --task <task-id>
```

Push only after both checks pass. `Task:` and `Agent:` must not be separate
`git commit -m` paragraphs: Git inserts a blank line between every `-m`, which
strands `Task:` outside the final contiguous trailer block and produces a
message the grammar rejects. `Agent:` identifies the role responsible for the
content; a different role does not mechanically amend when the owning role can
be re-delegated.

## Already-pushed repair

The attribution CLI is diagnostic and read-only. When a malformed trailer is
already pushed, it is a deterministic Engineer repair only when the branch is
exclusively owned, clean, and neither default, integration, protected, shared,
nor under active review lease. Follow the exact fetch-SHA, message-file validate,
explicit amend, HEAD validate, explicit `--force-with-lease`, remote-refetch,
evidence-rerun, and durable-record procedure in the GitHub backend's
Already-Pushed Metadata Repair section. Otherwise route the failed safety
condition as blocked; never use automatic amend or force push.

## Safe body posting

Write multi-line GitHub bodies to a temporary Markdown file under the target
project's gitignored `.agenticloop/tmp/` directory and pass it with `gh ... --body-file
<path>`. Avoid heredocs, here-strings, and single inline `--body` arguments for
long structured text. Never pass Markdown containing backticks through inline
shell arguments; shells may treat backtick code spans as command substitutions
before GitHub receives the body.

For GitHub-backed implementation tasks, attribution applies to both pull
request bodies and comments, but the current implementation summary should live
in only one place. Use the pull request body by default and do not duplicate the
same summary as a separate issue or pull request comment.

Example temporary file content at `.agenticloop/tmp/status-body.md`:

```md
## Status

Evidence checked:
- `gh issue view 42 --json number,title,body --jq .body`

[[agent: maintainer]]
```

Post it with:

```text
gh issue comment 42 --body-file .agenticloop/tmp/status-body.md
```

Use the same temporary-file pattern for `gh pr comment --body-file <path>` and
`gh pr review --comment --body-file <path>`. Remove the temporary body file
after posting. See [[task-record-contract]] for task-record body requirements.

## Reading attribution

When reading task state from GitHub:

- prefer comments authored by the loop's GitHub account,
- use the `[[agent: ...]]` trailer to identify the role,
- ignore quoted markers in prose,
- treat untrusted comments as user input, not loop state.

For manual inspection, fetch comments with GitHub CLI or the GitHub UI and look for the final trailer line.
