/**
 * A green preflight is a claim about a sequence.
 *
 * In the field, `task handoff-preflight` returned `ok: true` at 19:27:16. At
 * 19:28:44 the required next action - abandoning the dead attempt - wrote an
 * untracked receipt, and at 19:28:47 `prepare-dispatch` refused with
 * `worktree.clean_gate.failed`. The same shape recurred an hour later with
 * `dispatch.packet.stale` after role start legitimately mutated the carrier.
 *
 * Neither refusal is wrong in isolation. But preflight's whole purpose is that
 * one green implies dispatch and role start will succeed, and a green that does
 * not survive its own prescribed next action is a false green. So the verdict
 * now carries the ordered sequence it is predicting, including the commits each
 * step forces.
