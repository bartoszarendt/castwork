/**
 * Artifact binding asks about the task, and never about the repository.
 *
 * This is the invariant three consecutive fixes lacked. Each of them was
 * locally correct - the path classifier really did misclassify generated host
 * shims, then provisioned line-ending attributes - and each left the same
 * whole-repository question standing somewhere adjacent, where the next shared
 * path a real repository carries found it again. The classifier can only ever
 * enumerate paths the toolkit writes; `package-lock.json` is not one, and there
 * is always a next one.
 *
 * So the boundary is asserted mechanically rather than left to review: the
 * evidence gate that binds `implementation_artifact` reaches for the task's
 * declared surface and for nothing that classifies the repository at large.
 * The classifier keeps its other consumers - return-path classification still
 * needs to know what the toolkit itself wrote - it simply never decides this.
