/**
 * A task that becomes ready inside authorized intent.
 *
 * The field operator complaint was that a milestone of eight tasks read as eight
 * confirmations. Surfacing `--work-unit` at every refusal fixes discovery; this
 * fixes the rest - a task that reaches the ready set *after* the operator
 * authorized its work unit is inside their stated intent but outside the set
 * derived at activation time, so it asks again.
 *
 * Removing that second ask is only safe under one rule, and these cases exist
 * to keep the rule narrow: a lease derives without a new operator action only
 * for a task inside the **exact** scope confirmed. Otherwise "authorize the
 * milestone" quietly becomes "authorize whatever anyone later files under this
 * milestone", which is a materially different thing to consent to.
