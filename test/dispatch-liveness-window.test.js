/**
 * A packet must survive the repairs the toolkit itself demands.
 *
 * Two of six field attempts were abandoned for expiry rather than for any
 * semantic reason. The packet lost its dispatch liveness window while the
 * Orchestrator was performing preflight-mandated repairs; a later attempt
 * expired mid-cycle again forty minutes on, and the run then compressed the
 * remaining work into one pass specifically to beat the clock.
 *
 * The window was a hand-written hour. It was measuring how long a delegation
 * cycle takes, not whether anything the packet binds had changed - and every
 * one of those bindings is revalidated at consumption anyway.
